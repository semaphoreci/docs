There are two strategies for running CI tests. A developer either wants to get
a comprehensive report on all failures in a test suite or to get fast
feedback from the system and fail everything as soon as one of the jobs fails.

Semaphore runs all the jobs and prepares a comprehensive report for
your pipeline by default. By setting a Fail-Fast strategy in your pipelines
you can control this policy and get fast response for your pipelines.

One out of two Fail-Fast strategies can be used:

- A 'stop' strategy that stops everything in your pipeline as soon as a failure
  is detected.

- A 'cancel' strategy that stops only the jobs and blocks in your pipeline that
  haven't yet started. This option is ideal if you don't want to stop an already
  started test execution.

## Stopping all jobs in a pipeline on the first failure

To stop all the jobs in a pipeline on the first failure, set a fail-fast stop
policy in your pipeline YAML files.

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Tests
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

fail_fast:
  stop:
    when: "true"  # enable strategy for branches, tags, and pull-requests

blocks:
  - name: Unit Tests
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: "Unit Tests 1/2"
        commands:
          - make test PARTITION=1

      - name: "Unit Tests 2/2"
        commands:
          - make test PARTITION=2
```

If 'Unit Test 1/2' fails in the above pipeline, the 'Unit Test 2/2' will be
stopped.

## Stopping all jobs in a pipeline on the first failure on non-master branches

Often the fail-fast behavior is ideal for feature branches during development,
but it is not ideal for the master branch of your project where a comprehensive
report is better suited.

By changing the `when` condition to `branch != 'master'`, we can set a policy
that activates fail-fast only for non-master branches.

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Tests
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

fail_fast:
  stop:
    when: "branch != 'master'"

blocks:
  - name: Unit Tests
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: "Unit Tests 1/2"
        commands:
          - make test PARTITION=1

      - name: "Unit Tests 2/2"
        commands:
          - make test PARTITION=2
```

## The difference between Stop and Cancel Fail-Fast strategies

Sometimes it is not desirable to stop everything in a pipeline. Instead, we
would like to allow already running jobs and blocks to finish, but prevent new
ones from starting.

For these scenarios, the 'cancel' strategy can be configured for your pipelines.

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Tests
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

fail_fast:
  cancel:
    when: "branch != 'master'"

blocks:
  - name: Linter
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: "Linter"
        commands:
          - make lint

  - name: Security Scan
    dependencies: ["Linter"]
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: "Security"
        commands:
          - make scan-for-vulnerabilities

  - name: Unit Tests
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: "Unit Tests 1"
        commands:
          - make test

  - name: Integration Tests
    dependencies: ["Unit Tests"]
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: "Unit Tests 1"
        commands:
          - make test
```

In the above scenario, if linting fails, but the unit tests have already started,
we will not break them in the middle of the execution.

The Security Scan and Integration Tests will be canceled.
