The `ubuntu1804` is a customized image based on [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver/ReleaseNotes)
optimized for CI/CD. It comes with a set of preinstalled languages, databases,
and utility tools commonly used for CI/CD workflows. The image can be paired
with any [Linux machine type][machine-types] when defining the [agent][agent]
of your pipeline or block.

The `ubuntu1804` is a virtual machine (VM) image. The user in the environment,
named `semaphore`, has full `sudo` access.

The `ubuntu1804` VM uses an *APT mirror* that is in the same data center as
Semaphore's build cluster, which means that caching packages will have little
effect.

## Using the ubuntu1804 OS image in your agent configuration

To use the `ubuntu1804` OS image, define it as the `os_image` of your agent's
machine.

``` yaml
version: 1.0
name: Ubuntu18 Based Pipeline

agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: "Unit tests"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - make test
```

The `ubuntu1804` OS image can be used in combination with all Linux machine
types: `e1-standard-2`, `e1-standard-4`, `e1-standard-8`.

## Toolbox

The `ubuntu1804` comes with two utility tools. One for managing background
services and database, and one for managing language versions.
