## Hello world

```yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Ruby example
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804
blocks:
  - name: Hello world
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run some code
          commands:
            - ruby -e 'puts "evol".reverse'
```


## Ruby on Rails example project

Semaphore provides a tutorial and demo Rails application with a working
CI pipeline that you can use to get started quickly:

- [Ruby on Rails Continuous Integration tutorial][rails-tutorial]
- [Demo project on GitHub][rails-demo-project]

## Supported Ruby versions

Semaphore supports all versions of Ruby. You have the following options:

- Linux: Ruby is available out-of-the-box in the [Ubuntu 18.04 VM image][ubuntu-ruby].
- macOS: Ruby is available out-of-the-box in the [macOS VM image][macos-ruby].
- Docker: use [semaphoreci/ruby][ruby-docker-image] or
  [your own Docker image][docker-env] with the version of Ruby and other
  packages that you need.

Follow the links above for details on currently available language versions and
additional tools.

#### Selecting a Ruby version on Linux

On Linux, Semaphore uses [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage the supported
Ruby versions. Any Ruby version listed in
[Ubuntu image reference][ubuntu-ruby]
is supported and can be used on Semaphore jobs. The default version is set by the
`.ruby-version` file in your repository. If the `.ruby-version` file is present,
then you cannot force any other Ruby version for that directory. In that case
you will need to modify or delete `.ruby-version` in order to choose a different
Ruby version.

You can also change the active Ruby version by calling `sem-version ruby`
followed by the desired Ruby version. Here's an example:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - sem-version ruby 2.5.1
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - ruby --version
```

If the version of Ruby that you need is not currently available in the Linux VM,
we recommend running your jobs in [a custom Docker image][docker-env].

## Dependency caching

You can use Semaphores `cache` command to store and load a gem bundle
and configuration. In the following configuration example, we install
dependencies and warm the cache in the first block, then use the cache
in subsequent blocks.

``` yaml
#.semaphore/semaphore.yml

version: v1.0
name: Example Ruby pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Install dependencies
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: cache bundle
          commands:
            - checkout
            - cache restore
            - bundle install --deployment --path vendor/bundle
            - cache store

  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cache restore
          - bundle install --deployment --path vendor/bundle
      jobs:
        - name: Test all the things
          commands:
            - bundle exec rake test
```

If you need to clear cache for your project, launch a
[debug session](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/75-debugging-with-ssh-access)
and execute `cache clear` or `cache delete <key>`.

## Environment variables

Semaphore doesn't set language specific environment variables like
`RAILS_ENV` or `RACK_ENV`. You can set these at the task level.

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: RACK_ENV
          value: test
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - bundle exec rake test
```

## Database configuration

Rails 4.1+ supports using the `DATABASE_URL` to [configure a
database][rails-database-configuration]. Older versions of Rails need
to generate a `database/config.yml` manually.

### 4.1+ - Using DATABASE_URL

Rails will read database configuration from `DATABASE_URL` if set and
`config/database.yml` is empty. So, start a database with
[sem-service][sem-service], set `DATABASE_URL`, and clear the
existing `config/database.yml`. Here's an example block:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        # Matches the configuration used in sem-service
        - name: DATABASE_URL
          value: postgresql://postgres@localhost/test?encoding=utf8
        - name: RAILS_ENV
          value: test
      jobs:
        - name: Test all the things
          commands:
            - checkout
            - sem-service start postgres
            # Clear existing config/database.yml
            - cat /dev/null > config/database.yml
            - bin/rails db:create
            - bin/rails test
```

### Older Rails Versions

If your Rails version does not support `DATABASE_URL`, then you can
use a separate `config/database.yml` for CI.

Create a `database.yml` in `.semaphore` along side your pipeline
configurations. The configured `username` and `password` match the
connection info from [sem-service][sem-service].

``` yaml
# .semaphore/database.yml

test:
  adapter: postgresql
  database: test
  pool: 5
  username: postgres
  password: ~
```

Next, set `RAILS_ENV` and replace the existing `config/database.yml`
before running tests.

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: RAILS_ENV
          value: test
      jobs:
        - name: Test all the things
          commands:
            - checkout
            - sem-service start postgres
            # Use CI's database.yml
            - cp .semaphore/database.yml config/database.yml
            - bin/rails db:create
            - bin/rails test
```

## C-Extensions & system dependencies

Projects may need system packages to install gems like `pg`. Semaphore provides
full `sudo` access so you may install all required packages. Here's an
example of installing the `pg` gem.

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev
          - gem install pg
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - bundle exec rake test
```

## Browser testing

[Capybara](http://teamcapybara.github.io/capybara) is the recommended
solution for browser tests in Ruby. The Firefox, Chrome, and Chrome Headless
drivers work out of the box.

Refer to the [Ubuntu image reference](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/32-ubuntu-1804-image)
for details on preinstalled browsers and testing tools on Semaphore.
