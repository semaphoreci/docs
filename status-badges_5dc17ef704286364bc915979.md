This guide shows you how to create a badge that displays your project's current
build status. You can use this badge in README or website.

## Badge URL

URL of a badge has format:

`https://{ORGANIZATION_NAME}.semaphoreci.com/badges/{PROJECT_NAME}(/branches/{BRANCH_NAME}).svg`

For example, the badge for [semaphores documentation project](https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/projects/docs) will look like that:

https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/badges/docs.svg

![Semaphore docs](https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/badges/docs/branches/master.svg)

## Styles

You can choose between semaphore default style and [shield style](https://shields.io/).
To use the shield style, add `style=shield` as the query parameter in the badge
URL.

## Private projects

Build badges for private projects requires an additional `key` parameter.
The value of this parameter is a UUID of the project.
