This guide shows you how to use Semaphore to set up continuous deployment for
a static website.

## Example project

Semaphore provides an example open source project based on Gatsby.js which you
can use as an example for building a CI/CD pipeline for a static website:

- [Demo static website project on GitHub][demo-project]

The project includes a build pipeline and two deployment pipelines, for AWS S3
and Netlify:

![static website ci/cd pipeline](https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-static-website/raw/master/images/ci-pipeline-gatsby.png)

## Define the build pipeline

There are many static site generators, but the essential deployment steps are
the same for all:

1. Install the tools to generate the site, along with their dependencies;
2. Build the website from source files;
3. Upload the website files to cloud storage or host.

We'll start by setting up a Semaphore pipeline which maps the first two steps
to blocks. If all blocks run successfully on master branch, we'll automatically
[promote][promotions-guide] the code to the deployment pipeline.

This configuration also uses [caching][caching-guide] to store project's
dependencies, and pass the website files to the deployment pipeline.

The example is based on a static website built with a [Node.js][nodejs]
toolchain. Change the dependency installation and site building steps to match
your tools.

``` yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: "Deploy website"
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: "Install dependencies"
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: npm install
        commands:
          - checkout
          # Reuse dependencies from cache and avoid installing them from scratch:
          - cache restore
          - npm install
          - cache store

  - name: "Build site"
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: Build
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cache restore
          # Replace this with command(s) that build your website:
          - npm run build:all
          # The script puts website files in directory `public`,
          # store it in cache to propagate to deployment:
          - cache store website-build public

promotions:
  - name: Production deploy
    pipeline_file: production-deploy.yml
    auto_promote_on:
      - result: passed
        branch:
          - master
```

## Deployment to AWS S3

In this example, we'll deploy our static website to AWS S3.

### Configure deployment credentials

To perform deployment in a CI/CD job, we need to use valid AWS credentials.
A secure way to pass our credentials to Semaphore
is by defining a [secret][secrets-guide].

Create a new secret based on local `~/.aws` configuration files:

``` bash
sem create secret aws-website \
  --file ~/.aws/config:/home/semaphore/.aws/config \
  --file ~/.aws/credentials:/home/semaphore/.aws/credentials
```

The above ensures that the files sourced from our local machine will be placed
in the home directory of the user which executes our code on Semaphore.

### Deploy website by uploading files to S3

Finally, create a file `.semaphore/production-deploy.yml` to execute
deployment, and import the secret for authentication to work:

``` yaml
# .semaphore/production-deploy.yml
version: v1.0
name: Deploy website
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804
blocks:
  - name: Deploy
    task:
      secrets:
        - name: aws-website
      jobs:
        - name: Copy to S3
          commands:
            - checkout
            - cache restore website-build
            - aws s3 sync "public" "s3://bucket-name" --acl "public-read"
```

Thatâ€™s it. Your website will now be continuously deployed every time there is
a valid change on master branch. Deployment won't run on other branches and
pull requests. However, Semaphore will report a build failure in case there's
an error which prevents the website to be generated, so that you can fix it
before merging to master.

## Deploy to Netlify
