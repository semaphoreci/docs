## Overview

This document will show you how you can use Layer Caching in Docker in order to
make your builds faster and is indented for Semaphore 2.0 users that create
Docker containers in their Semaphore 2.0 projects.

## About Layer Caching in Docker

Docker creates container images using layers. Each command that is found in a
`Dockerfile` creates a new layer. Each layers contains the filesystem changes
of the image between the state before the execution of the command and the
state after the execution of the command.

Docker uses a layer cache to optimize the process of building Docker images
and make it faster.

Docker Layer Caching mainly works on `RUN`, `COPY` and `ADD` commands, which are
going to be explained in more detail.

### The RUN Command

The `RUN` command allows you to execute a command in the Docker image. If the
layer that is generated by the `RUN` command already exists in cache, the `RUN`
command will be executed only once.

As you will see in a while, a `COPY` or an `ADD` command can invalidate the
layer cache and make Docker to execute all `RUN` commands.

### The COPY Command

The `COPY` command in a `Dockerfile` allows you to import one or more external
files into a Docker image. The `COPY` commands always get executed in order to
have the latest version of the external file.

If the contents of all external files on the first `COPY` command are the
same, the layer cache will be used and **all subsequent** commands until the
next `ADD` or `COPY` command will use the layer cache.

However, if the contents of one or more external files are different, then
**all subsequent** commands will be executed without using the layer cache.

In order to take advantage of Layer Caching in Docker you should structure your
`Dockerfile` in a way that frequently changing steps such as `COPY` to be
located towards the end of the `Dockerfile` file. This will ensure that the
steps concerned with doing the same action are not unnecessarily rebuilt.

### The ADD Command

The `ADD` command in a `Dockerfile` allows you to import external files into
a Docker image. 

If the contents of all external files on the first `ADD` command are the
same, the layer cache will be used and **all subsequent** commands until the
next `ADD` or `COPY` command will use the layer cache.

However, if the contents of one or more external files are different, then
**all subsequent** commands will be executed without using the layer cache.

In order to take advantage of Layer Caching in Docker you should structure your
`Dockerfile` in a way that frequently changing steps such as `ADD` to be
located towards the end of the `Dockerfile` file. This will ensure that the
steps concerned with doing the same action are not unnecessarily rebuilt.

## About --cache-from

The `--cache-from` command line option in the `docker` command allows to build
a new image using a pre-existing one as the cache source. You will see that in
action in the next section.

## An example Semaphore 2.0 project

The first thing that you will need is to create a secret in Semaphore 2.0. If
your secret with the Docker Registry data is called `docker-hub`, you can find
out more information about it as follows:

    $ sem get secrets docker-hub
    apiVersion: v1beta
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: docker-hub
      id: a2aaefdb-a4ff-4bc2-afd9-2afa9c7f3e51
      create_time: "1538456457"
      update_time: "1538456537"
    data:
      env_vars:
      - name: DOCKER_USERNAME
        value: docker-username
      - name: DOCKER_PASSWORD
        value: docker-password
      files: []

The following Semaphore 2.0 project illustrates the use of Docker Layer Caching
in Semaphore 2.0 projects:

    version: v1.0
    name: Using Docker Layer Cache
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    
    blocks:
      - name: Create Docker image
        task:
          jobs:
            - name: Store Docker image in Registry
              commands:
                - checkout
                - echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login --username "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin
                - cp D1 Dockerfile
                - docker build -t go_hw:v1 .
                - docker tag go_hw:v1 "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH"
                - docker push "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH"
				
                - docker tag go_hw:v1 "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA"-"$SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID"
				- docker push "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA"-"$SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID"
				    
          secrets:
          - name: docker-hub
    
      - name: Use previous image
        task:
          jobs:
            - name: Use restored Docker image as cache
              commands:
                - checkout
                - docker images
                - echo $DOCKER_PASSWORD | docker login --username "$DOCKER_USERNAME" --password-stdin
                - cp D2 Dockerfile
                - docker pull "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH"
                - docker build --cache-from "$DOCKER_USERNAME:go_hw:$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH" -t go_hw:v2 .
                - docker images
                - docker run go_hw:v2
    
          secrets:
          - name: docker-hub

The `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file has two `blocks` blocks. The first one
creates a Docker image that is reused in the second `blocks` block using the
`--cache-from` command line parameter.

The block named "Use previous image" simulates the case where a number of
unchanged layers will be reused from an image that was pulled from the Docker
Registry. In this case all layers will be reused. The `docker` commands that
use this functionality are the following:

    - docker pull "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH"
    - docker build --cache-from "$DOCKER_USERNAME:go_hw:$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH" -t go_hw:v2 .

The `docker pull` command gets an existing Docker image from the Docker
Registry whereas the `docker build` command uses the `--cache-from` option in
order to try to reuse as many of the existing layers of the
`$DOCKER_USERNAME:go_hw:$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH` image as possible.

    - docker tag go_hw:v1 "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH"
    - docker push "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH"

The aforementioned commands tar an existing Docker image and push it to the
Docker registry in a way that can be found and reused as a cache Docker image.

    - docker tag go_hw:v1 "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA"-"$SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID"
	- docker push "$DOCKER_USERNAME"/go_hw:"$SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA"-"$SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID"

The last two `docker` commands should be executed when you want to deploy a
Docker image to production. The first one tags an existing Docker image in a
way that can be associated to the Git SHA value and the Workflow ID of the
Semaphore 2.0 project and the second one pushes that image to Docker Registry.

The contents of the `D1` file are as follows:

	$ cat D1
	FROM golang:alpine
    
	RUN mkdir /files
	COPY hw.go /files
	WORKDIR /files
    
	RUN go build -o /files/hw hw.go

The contents of the `D2` file are as follows:

	$ cat D2
	FROM golang:alpine
    
	RUN mkdir /files
	COPY hw.go /files
	WORKDIR /files
    
	RUN go build -o /files/hw hw.go
	ENTRYPOINT ["/files/hw"]

The `D2` file includes all the contents of the `D1` file and adds one more
line at the end of it, which makes it a perfect candidate for using the
Docker image created using `D1` as a cache.

To ensure a better cache hit, you should choose The `SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH`
Semaphore 2.0 environment variable as a tag. This way, each GitHub branch will
have its own cache and therefore you will avoid cache collision.
