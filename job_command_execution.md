## Overview
In Semaphore every job executes commands in a new interactive shell
which means that all exported variables are available during the build:

```
blocks:
  - name: "Tests"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: "Test job"
          commands:
            - export VAR1=MyTestVar
            - checkout
            - echo $VAR1
```

The same applies to changing directories. If you change a directory
next command will be executed inside that directory:

```
blocks:
  - name: "Tests"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: "Test job"
          commands:
            - git clone git@github.com:semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-ruby-rails.git
            - cd semaphore-demo-ruby-rails
            - bundle install --path vendor/bundle
```

Default shell for all semaphore jobs is `bash`:

## What happens if you execute `exit 1`
`exit` implies an exit value of your script. Your script may exit successfully
although it tests for an erroneous condition. In this case, you specifically
want it to exit with the error condition e.g `exit 1`.

## What happens if you set `set -e`
`set -e` stops the execution of a script if any command exits with a non-zero status,
which is the opposite of the default shell behavior to ignore errors in scripts.

Semaphore checks exit value of each executed command so there is no need to include this
options in the command sections.

## The difference between sourcing and running a bash script
Executing a script calling `bash script.sh`, runs it in a separate instance of shell which is invoked to process the script. This means that any environment variables, defined in the script can't be updated in the current shell.

Sourcing a script means that it is parsed and executed by the current shell itself. It's as if you typed the contents of the script.
