# Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Semaphore documentation as
easy and transparent as possible.

All currently planned tasks are filed as [issues][issues] within this
repository. Issues are categorized using a small set of [labels][labels] that
correspond to sections of the [documentation website][docs-website]. All changes
go through a standard pull request process.

## Ways to contribute

1. Reporting errors, something not being clear enough, or expected information
   missing — [open a new issue][new-issue];
2. Discussing the current state of content — [open a new issue][new-issue];
3. Proposing new topics — [open a new issue][new-issue];
4. Submitting an improvement — submit a pull request.

When contributing new content, please first discuss the change you wish to make
through the corresponding issue before making a change.

## Order of priority

Unless agreed otherwise, this is the order of priority by label:

1. [reference][reference-issues], which includes "CI/CD Environment" and
  "Reference" categories on website.
2. [guided tour][guided-tour-issues]
3. [account mgmt][account-mgmt-issues]
4. [languages][languages-issues]
5. [use-case][use-case-issues]

## Writing

- Prefer active over passive voice.
- Edit your first draft to say the same thing with less words.
- Verify any configuration or code that's part of your content in a working
  Semaphore project.

## Text formatting

We follow a few rules:

- All text must be limited to 80 characters, to make discussing changes in pull
  requests easier.
- Prefer reference-style links.

When in doubt use any of the current files as an example.

Markdown files need to follow a naming pattern to match records in CMS. If
you're an external contributor and would like to create a new page, simply
create an `.md` file with any name and submit a pull request. Someone from the
Semaphore team will make sure it's published.
