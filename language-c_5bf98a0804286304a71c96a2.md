## Supported C versions

The following Semaphore 2.0 project selects a different `gcc` version:


## Dependency Management

As there is no standard way to perform dependency management in C, we will skip
that in this guide.

You can use the `cache` Semaphore 2.0 utility to store and load any files or C
libraries that you want to reuse in other jobs.

## Environment variables

Semaphore 2.0 does not set environment variables related to C so you will have
to define them on your own at the task level.

## System dependencies

C projects might need packages like database drivers. As you have full `sudo`
access on each Semaphore 2.0 MV, you are free to install all required packages.
