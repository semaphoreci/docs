Semaphore 2.0 allows your to store confidential information in secrets using
environment variables and files.

You can think of a `secrets` as a bucket in which you can place your
confidential information in the form of environment variables and
configuration files. Although you cannot have an environment variable
name to appear more than once in the same `secrets`, you can have
multiple `secrets` lists that contain the same environment variable
name.

Last `secrets` are connected to organizations, which means that if you
create a `secrets` under an organization you will be able to use it in
all the Semaphore 2.0 projects of that organization.

# How you can put secrets in Semaphore 2.0

In this section you will learn how you can add your confidential
information in a Semaphore 2.0 `secrets`. Semaphore 2.0 supports two
ways for including confidential information: environment variables and
configuration files.

It is really important to understand that you are responsible for
putting the desired data using the desired format into a configuration
file.

So, the first thing to do is connecting to an organization as explained
in the [Changing Organizations][1]{: target="_blank"} documentation
page.

## Creating a secret

In this section you will learn how to create a secret for storing
confidential information in the form of environment variables and
configuration files.

The following YAML file create a new `secrets` item that is called
`more-mihalis-secrets` with two environment variables, named
`SECRET_ONE` and `SECRET_TWO`\:

``` yaml
# createSecret.yml

apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: more-mihalis-secrets
data:
  env_vars:
    - name: SECRET_ONE
      value: "Ca c'est un petite secret"
    - name: SECRET_TWO
      value: "Secret deux"
```

The you will have to execute the  `sem` command line tool as follows:

``` bash
$ sem create -f createSecret.yml
apiVersion: v1alpha
data:
  env_vars:
  - name: SECRET_ONE
    value: Ca c'est un petite secret
  - name: SECRET_TWO
    value: Secret deux
kind: Secret
metadata:
  id: 3e0938ac-b752-46ae-982f-c63ce817d847
  name: more-mihalis-secrets
```

Now, you can verify that a new  `secret` item has been created as
follows:

``` yaml
$ sem get secrets
NAME
mihalis-secrets
more-mihalis-secrets
```

### Listing the contents of a secrets property

You can list of the values of an existing  `secrets` as follows:

``` bash
$ sem describe secrets more-mihalis-secrets
apiVersion: v1alpha
data:
  env_vars:
  - name: SECRET_ONE
    value: Ca c'est un petite secret
  - name: SECRET_TWO
    value: Secret deux
kind: Secret
metadata:
  id: e6092e1d-a3c3-43b9-a209-5370f3835a9e
  name: more-mihalis-secrets
```

The next section will show how to list all the existing `secrets` of an
organization.

### Listing all the contents of all the secrets of an organization

The following script will help you list all the contents of all
the `secrets` of an organization:

``` bash
sem get secrets | grep -v NAME | xargs -n1 sem describe secrets
```

Its output will look as follows:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
data:
  env_vars:
  - name: SECRET_ONE
    value: Ca c'est un petite secret
  - name: SECRET_TWO
    value: Secret deux
kind: Secret
metadata:
  id: a7c4d405-3344-4b88-9303-6827ad38f701
  name: mySecrets

apiVersion: v1alpha
data:
  env_vars:
  - name: SECRET_ONE
    value: Ca c'est un petite secret
  - name: SECRET_TWO
    value: Secret deux
kind: Secret
metadata:
  id: e6092e1d-a3c3-43b9-a209-5370f3835a9e
  name: more-mihalis-secrets

apiVersion: v1alpha
data:
  env_vars:
  - name: SECRET_ONE
    value: Ca c'est un petite secret
kind: Secret
metadata:
  id: b7bc03c0-2c0c-4317-b8fa-fa57d671f417
  name: mihalis-secrets
```

### Listing the available secrets

As you already saw, in order to list all the available `secrets` values,
you should execute the next command:

``` bash
$ sem get secrets
NAME
mihalis-secrets
more-mihalis-secrets
even-more-mihalis-secrets
```

### Deleting a secret

You can delete an existing `secrets` by executing the following command:

``` bash
sem delete secret mihalis-secrets
```

You can now verify that the desired `secrets` has been deleted as
follows:

``` bash
$ sem get secrets
NAME
more-mihalis-secrets
even-more-mihalis-secrets
```

If the  `secrets` you want to delete does not exist, you will get the
following kind of error message:

``` bash
$ sem delete secret mihalis-secrets
{"message":"Bad Request"}
```

# How you can use secrets in Semaphore 2.0

In the previous section, you learned how you can add confidential
information into a `secrets` and add that `secrets` to your Semaphore
2.0 organization. In this section, you will learn how to use your
confidential data, either as environment variables or as files.

Notice that you should select the `secrets` you want using the `name`
property.

## A complete example

The Semaphore 2.0 pipeline that will be used for the example project is
defined as follows:

``` yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Basic YAML configuration file example.
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804
blocks:
  - task:
      jobs:
        - name: My Semaphore 2.0 job
          commands:
            - checkout
            - ls -l .semaphore
            - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
            - echo "Hello World!"
            - echo $SECRET_ONE
            - echo $SECRET_TWO
      secrets:
        - name: mySecrets
        - name: more-mihalis-secrets
```

Please notice that when the names of the environment variables of two
more more `secrets` are the same, then the environment variable will
have the value that can be found in the `secrets` property that was
imported last.

## What if you try to use a secret that does not exist

Now, it is time to learn what will happen when you try to use a
`secrets` in your `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file that does not exist.

The `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file that will be used is the following:

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Using secrets in Semaphore 2.0
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804
blocks:
- task:
      jobs:
        - name: My Semaphore 2.0 job
          commands:
            - echo "Hello World!"
            - echo $SECRET_ONE
            - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
      secrets:
        - name: does-not-exist
```

In that case the pipeline will fail to run.

## Errors

Errors happen all the time. So if there is something wrong and you
cannot get any data from the servers, you are going to see an error
message similar to the following:

$ sem get secrets
error: http status 502 received from upstream

Another kind of error you can get when dealing with  `secrets` is the
following:

    $ sem -v get secrets
    2018/07/05 00:22:09 https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/api/v1alpha/secrets
    2018/07/05 00:22:13 response Status: 504 Gateway Timeout
    2018/07/05 00:22:13 response Headers: map[Alt-Svc:[clear] Content-Length:[24] Content-Type:[text/plain] Date:[Wed, 04 Jul 2018 21:22:12 GMT] Server:[envoy] Via:[1.1 google]]
    2018/07/05 00:22:13 upstream request timeout
    error: http status 504 received from upstream

Generally speaking using the `-v` switch when things go wrong might help
you or Rendered Text reveal the root of problem and correct it.
