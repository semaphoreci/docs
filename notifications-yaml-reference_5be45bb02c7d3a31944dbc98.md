## Overview

This document is the reference to the YAML grammar used for describing
notifications and specifying notification rules.

Notifications can be sent only when a pipeline is finished, either successfully
or unsuccessfully. Additionally, you will need the `sem` command line tool in
order to work with notifications.

## Properties

### apiVersion

The `apiVersion` property defines the version of the YAML grammar that will be
used in the current YAML file. Different versions might have different
features.

The list of values for `apiVersion`: `v1alpha`.

### kind

The `kind` property defines the purpose of the YAML file. For a YAML file that
will be used for defining notifications, the value of the `kind` property should
be `Notification`.

The list of values for `kind`: `Notification`.

### metadata

The `metadata` property defines the metadata of a Notifications YAML file and
supports the `name`, `id`, `create_time` and `update_time`.

#### name

The value of the `name` property in the `metadata` context, which is a string,
defines the name of the notification. This is what will appear when you execute
the `sem get notifications` command.

#### id

The value of the `id` property is automatically generated and assigned by
Semaphore 2.0 and is unique among all notifications. It should not be edited.

#### create_time

The value of the `create_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time of creation of the
notification.

#### update_time

The value of the `update_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the last time the notification
was altered.

### spec

The `spec` property holds the list of notification rules.

#### rules

Each `rules` property holds the definition of a notification rule.

In order to define a notification you will need to have at least one `rules`
item.

## The rules property in more detail

In this section we are going to explain the properties that are used in a
`rules` property.

### rule name

The value of the `name` property, which is a string, defines the name of the
notification rule.

### filter

The `filter` property holds the `projects`, `branches` and `pipelines`
properties. The `projects` property is the only mandatory one.

The values of `branches`, `projects` and `pipelines` properties can contain
regular expressions. Regex matches must be wrapped in forward slashes (`/.-/`).
Specifying a branch/project/pipeline name without slashes (`.-`) would execute
a direct equality match.

For a filter to be `true`, each one of its properties should be `true`. If a
property such as `branches` has multiple values, at least one of these values
should be `true` for the entire property to be `true`.

The `filter` property holds the logic of the notification rule.

#### projects

The `projects` property is used for holding the list of the Semaphore 2.0
projects that interest us.

The `projects` property is mandatory.

#### branches

The `branches` property holds a list of strings, which should be the GitHub
branch names that interest us.

The `branches` property is optional.

#### pipelines

The `pipelines` property is used for holding the list of the pipeline filenames
that interest us.

The `pipelines` property is optional.

### notify

The `notify` property holds the `slack` and `webhook` properties.

#### slack

The `slack` property holds the `endpoint` and `channels` properties.

##### endpoint

The `endpoint` property holds the URL of the Incoming WebHook that will be used.
Incoming WebHooks offer a simple way for posting messages from external sources
into Slack.

You can learn more about defining the value of the `endpoint` property by
visiting [Incoming WebHooks](https://slack.com/apps/A0F7XDUAZ-incoming-webhooks).

Please note that if a notification does not work as expected, you might want to
begin the debugging process by verifying the Slack WebHook used.

Tip: you can use just a single Incoming WebHook from Slack for all your
notifications as this Incoming WebHook has access to all the channels of a
Slack Workspace.

The `endpoint` property is mandatory.

##### channels

The `channels` property holds a list of strings. Each string item is the name
of a Slack channel or the name of a Slack user. Slack channels begin with a `#`
character and Slack users begin with a `@` character.

A notification can send a message to multiple Slack channels and/or multiple
users.

The `channels` property is optional. When the `channels` property is not
defined, all notifications go to the default channel associated with the
Incoming WebHook used.

#### webhook

The `webhook` property holds the `endpoint`, `action`, and `timeout` properties.

##### endpoint

The `endpoint` property holds the URL to which Semaphore will send notification.

You can learn more about payload of a notification visiting
[Webhook Notification](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/170-webhook-notifications).

The `endpoint` property is mandatory.

##### action

The `action` property holds the HTTP method used to send notification.

The `action` property is optional, and default value is `POST`.

##### timeout

The `timeout` property holds the delivery timeout in ms. Must be in range
(1..1000)ms.

The `timeout` property is optional, and default value is `500`.

## An example

The following YAML code present an example of a notification as returned by the
`sem get notification [name]` command:

``` bash
$ sem get notifs docs
apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: docs
  id: 2222f08c-93f9-459b-8825-ab8be49c9d19
  create_time: "1542024088"
  update_time: "1542280192"
spec:
  rules:
  - name: Send notifications for docs project
    filter:
      projects:
      - API-docs
    notify:
      slack:
        endpoint: https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXTXXSSA/ABCDDAS/XZYZWAFDFD
        channels:
        - '#devops'
        - '@mtsoukalos'
  - name: On finished pipelines for S1, docs, or .*-api projects
    filter:
      projects:
      - website
      - /.*-api$/
      - docs
      branches:
      - /^feature-.*/
      - master
      pipelines:
      - semaphore.yml
    notify:
      webhook:
        endpoint: https://example.org/postreceiver
status: {}
```

This notification has two rules, one named `Send notifications for docs project`
and another named `On finished pipelines for S1, docs, or .*-api projects`.

The first rule of the notification specifies a single project name that is
called `API-docs`. All notifications will go to the `#devops` **channel** and
to the `mtsoukalos` **user** using the specified Incoming WebHook of Slack. In
this case the Slack channel associated with the specified Incoming WebHook will
be ignored.

The second rule is more complex than the first one. The values of the `projects`
property specify two exact project names named `website` and `docs` as well as
a regular expression (`/.*-api$/`) that will be evaluated against all the
project names of the current organization. For this filter to be `true`, at
least one of the matches must be `true`.

Similarly, the `branches` property has two items. The first one is a regular
expression that matches all branches that begin with the `feature` string
and the second one is an exact match to the `master` branch.

After that, you specify in the `pipelines` filter that you are only interested
in the main pipeline that always begins with the `semaphore.yml` file.

Once these three filters are evaluated to `true`, the rule will send a
notification to the `https://example.org/postreceiver` URL.

Please note that the `status` property at the end is not currently being used.
