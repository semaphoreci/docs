Semaphore has webhook based notifications that are delivered on the success or
failure of a pipeline. When criteria for notification are met, Semaphore will
send a HTTP POST payload to the webhook's configured URL. You can use them,
for example, to implement alerts through [Hubot](https://github.com/hubotio/hubot),
or keep track of your projects on a company dashboard.

## Setting up webhook notifications for a project

Use your Endpoint URL to set up a notification on Semaphore,
with the following command:

``` bash
$ sem create notification [name] \
    --projects [project_name] \
    --webhook-endpoint [webhook-endpoint]
```

For example, if you have a project called `web` and you want to get a webhook
notification on every finished pipeline on the `master` branch, use the
following command:

``` bash
$ sem create notification master-pipelines \
    --projects web \
    --branches master \
    --webhook-endpoint [webhook-endpoint]
```

## Setting up webhook notifications for multiple projects

When creating a notification, you can specify multiple projects as source,
of your notifications.

For example, if your team manages three projects named `web`, `cli` and `api`
and you want to get notified for every finished pipeline on the master branch,
use the following command:

``` bash
$ sem create notifications teamA-notifications \
    --projects "web,cli,api" \
    --branches "master" \
    --webhook-endpoint [webhook-endpoint]
```

## Filtering by project, branch and pipeline names

When creating a notification, you can specify a filter for project, branch and
pipeline names.

For example to send notifications for the `master` and `staging` branches use
the following:

``` bash
$ sem create notifications example \
    --branches "master,staging" \
    --webhook-endpoint [webhook-endpoint] \
```

A filter can either be a regex match or a direct match. Specifying a filter with
forward slashes (e.g. /hotfix-.*/) defines a regex match, while a filter without
forward slashes (e.g. master) defines a direct match.

``` bash
$ sem create notifications example \
    --branches "master,/hotfix\/.*/" \
    --webhook-endpoint [webhook-endpoint] \
```

Matching can be specified for project and pipeline names as well. For example,
if you want to get notified about every notification on a project that matches
`/.*-api$/`, on the master branch, when the `prod.yml` pipeline is executed, use:

``` bash
$ sem create notifications example \
    --projects "/.*api$/" \
    --branches "master" \
    --pipelines "prod.yml" \
    --webhook-endpoint [webhook-endpoint] \
```

## Advanced notification setup

In the previous examples we looked at simple use cases where we used the CLI
interface to set up a new notification.

For more complex use cases, defining a notification YAML resource offers full
control over the rules used for dispatching notifications.

### Filtering by pipeline result

You can specify notifications to be sent only on specific pipeline results.

Available values for the results filter are:

- `passed`
- `failed`
- `stopped`
- `canceled`

Example YAML configuration:

``` yaml
# notify-on-fail.yml

apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Notification
metadata:
  name: notify-on-fail
spec:
  rules:
    - name: "Example"
      filter:
        projects:
          - example-project
        results:
          - failed
      notify:
        webhook:
          endpoint: https://example.org/postreceiver
```

Note that you can list more than one value under `results`.

You can create a notification using the file above with:

``` bash
sem create -f notify-on-fail.yml
```

## Modifying notification settings

Notification settings can be listed, described, edited and deleted in your
organization by using the [sem command line tool](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/53-sem-reference).

- List notifications with: `sem get notifications`
- Describe a notification with: `sem get notifications [name]`
- Edit a notification with: `sem edit notification [name]`
- Delete a notification with: `sem delete notification [name]`

See the [sem command line tool](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/53-sem-reference)
for further details.

## Setting up, editing and deleting webhook notifications through the UI

In the Configuration part of the sidebar, click on **Notifications** -> **Create New
Notification**. Add the name of the notification and rules and click on the **Save
Changes** button.

If youâ€™d like to edit or delete an existing notification, click on the name of
the notification and at the top right corner, click on **Edit** or **Delete...** button
and follow the steps from there.

## Notification payload

The payload contains all the information related to a pipeline.

In this example `revision.pull_request` and `revision.tag` are null because
payload is related to pipeline run started from a push to the branch. Information
about this is kept in `revision.reference_type`.

Sample `pull_request` object:

```json
"pull_request": {
  "head_repo_slug": "renderedtext/notifications",
  "number": 2,
  "name": "Add docs for webhook notifications",
  "head_sha": "9872252e00ac5a6b5870cdf94efe0e04770ad104",
  "branch_name": "webhook_notifications",
  "commit_range": "9872252e00ac5a6b5870cdf94efe0e04770ad104^..9872252e00ac5a6b5870cdf94efe0e04770ad104"
}
```

Sample `tag` object:

```json
"tag": {
  "name": "v1.0.1",
}
```
