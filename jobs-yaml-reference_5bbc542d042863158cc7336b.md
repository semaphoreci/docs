## Overview

This document is the reference to the YAML grammar used for describing jobs.

## An example

This reference page will begin with an YAML example as returned by the
`sem get jobs [JOB ID]` command:

    $ sem get jobs 33cbe5af-fafb-424b-b06f-12006929cb08
    apiVersion: v1alpha
    kind: Job
    metadata:
      name: Deploy
      id: 33cbe5af-fafb-424b-b06f-12006929cb08
      create_time: "1539327331"
      update_time: "1539327332"
      start_time: "1539327334"
      finish_time: "1539327340"
    spec:
      agent:
        machine:
          type: e1-standard-2
          os_image: ubuntu1804
      files: []
      envvars:
      - name: SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA
        value: f7da446084515d25db52b4fe6146db6e81ded482
      - name: SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH
        value: master
      - name: SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID
        value: 0137eba3-fb19-41f8-87ac-77e040d437f6
      - name: SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ARTEFACT_ID
        value: b6452489-3bd7-4a09-a73d-a834b6cad1ac
      - name: SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
        value: b6452489-3bd7-4a09-a73d-a834b6cad1ac
      - name: SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_0_ARTEFACT_ID
        value: b6452489-3bd7-4a09-a73d-a834b6cad1ac
      secrets:
      - name: docker-secrets
      commands:
      - checkout
      - gem install redcarpet
      - if [ $SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH == "master" ]; then ./deploy_docs.rb; fi
      project_id: 0dd982e8-32f5-4037-983e-4de01ac7fb1e
    status:
      state: FINISHED
      result: PASSED
      agent:
        ip: 94.130.207.151
        ports:
        - name: ssh
          number: 57693

So, the description of a job as returned by Semaphore 2.0 contains many
properties. Some of them are defined by Semaphore 2.0 whereas other can be
defined by the user. You can visit the [sem command line tool Reference](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/53-sem-reference)
page for learning how to define a job using the `sem create -f` command.

## Properties

### apiVersion

The `apiVersion` property defines the version of the YAML grammar that will be
used in the current YAML file. Different versions might have different
features.

The list of values for `apiVersion`: `v1alpha`.

### kind

The `kind` property defines the purpose of the YAML file. For a YAML file that
will be used for defining jobs, the value of the `kind` property should
be `Secret`.

The list of values for `kind`: `Job`.

### metadata

The `metadata` property defines the metadata of the Jobs YAML file and supports
the `name`, `id`, `create_time`, `update_time`, `start_time` and `finish_time`
properties.

Currently, only the `name` property can be changed by the user but this might
change in future versions.

#### name

The value of the `name` property, which is a string, in the `metadata` context
defines the name of the job.

As each job is uniquely identified by its Job ID, multiple jobs can share the
same job name without conflicts.

#### id

The value of the id property is automatically generated and assigned by
Semaphore 2.0 and is unique among all jobs. It should not be edited.

#### create_time

The value of the `create_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time of creation of the job.

#### update_time

The value of the `update_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the last time the job was altered.

#### start_time

The value of the `start_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time that the job started
to execute.

#### finish_time

The value of the `finish_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time that the job finished
its execution.

### spec

The `spec` property holds a list of properties that hold the full specification
of a job.

#### agent

The `agent` property holds one additional property named `machine`, that
identifies the environment, that is the hardware of the Virtual machine and the
Operating System of the Virtual Machine, in which the job will get executed.

The values that are found under the `agent` property are defined in the
pipeline file that the job belongs to – in this case you should not change
them on your own. However, if you are creating a new job, you can define the
values of `type` and `os_image` as you wish, provided that you will be using
valid values.

You can learn more about the `agent` property and the properties under it at
the [Pipeline YAML Reference](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/50-pipeline-yaml)
page.

#### machine

The `machine` property, which can only be defined under `agent`, requires two
properties named `type` and `os_image`.

#### type

The `type` property is intended for specifying the machine (hardware) you would
use on the Virtual Machine for building a specific job.

The list of values for `type`: `e1-standard-2`.

#### os_image

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the
operating system that will be used on the Virtual Machine.

The list of values for `os_image`: `ubuntu1804`.

#### files

The `files` property holds a list of file items used for the job. Each file is
represented by a `path` and `content` pair.

#### envvars

The `envvars` property holds a list of `name` and `value` pairs that represent
environment variables.

##### name

The `name` property defines the name of the environment variable.

##### value

The `value` property defines the value of the environment variable.

#### secrets

The `secrets` property holds a list with the `secrets` that will be imported
for this job.

#### commands

The `commands` property holds the commands of the job. As a result the value of
the `commands` property is a list of strings, which are the commands of the
job.

### status

The `status` property is for holding a list of other properties that define
the status of the job. This list includes the `state`, `result` and `agent`
properties.

#### state

The `state` property holds the state of the job.

The list of values for `state`: `PENDING`, `QUEUED`, `RUNNING` and `FINISHED`.

* `PENDING`: the job is accepted by the Semaphore 2.0 system.
* `QUEUED`: the job is waiting for available capacity.
* `RUNNING`: the job is processing commands.
* `FINISHED`: the job processing has finished and its result has been calculated.

#### result

The `result` property holds the result of the job. If the job is in running
state then the value of `result` will be `""`.

The list of values for `result`: `NONE`, `PASSED`, `FAILED` and `STOPPED`.

* `NONE`: the jobs has not yet finished.
* `PASSED`: the job has successfully finished.
* `FAILED`: the job has failed, either because a command has failed or because
    one or more dependancies were not available.
* `STOPPED`: the job was terminated before finishing.

#### agent

The `agent` property holds two other properties, named `ip` and `ports` that
specify the IP address and the TCP port number used by the agent that runs the
job.

##### ip

The value of the `ip` property is the IP address of the Virtual Machine used
for executing the job. This value is provided by Semaphore 2.0 and should not
be changed.

##### ports

The `ports` property holds a `name` and `number` pair. The value of the `name`
property is the protocol used, which is `ssh`, and the value of the `number`
property is the TCP port number used for the `ssh` connection.
