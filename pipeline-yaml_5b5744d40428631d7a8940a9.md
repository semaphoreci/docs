# Pipeline YAML Reference

This document is the reference for the YAML grammar used for describing the pipelines of Semaphore 2.0.

The core properties of a Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file are `blocks`, which appear only once at the beginning of a YAML file, `task`, which can appear multiple times and `jobs`, which can also be repeated.


# Comments

Lines that begin with # are considered comments and are being ignored by the YALM parser, which is not a Semaphore 2.0 feature but the way YAML files work.


# The preamble
Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.


## Constants

### The e1-standard-2 constant

The `e1-standard-2` value used in the preamble represents the hardware of the Virtual Machine used for each job in the current pipeline and is a global variable.


### The ubuntu1804 constant

The `ubuntu1804` value used in the preamble represents the Operating System of the Virtual Machine used for each job in the current pipeline and is a global variable.



# Properties


## version

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used.

List of valid values: `"v1.0"`

Example: `version: "v1.0"`

## name

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the Semaphore 2.0 project and is optional.

*Caution*: The `name` property can be found in other sections because it is used
for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a `task` section defined using `task`.

Example: `name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"`


## agent

The `agent` property requires three additional properties that identify the
environment, that is the hardware of the Virtual machine and the Operating System
of the Virtual Machine, in which the jobs of the pipeline will get executed.

Example:

    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804


### machine

The `machine` property, which can only be found under `agent`, holds the `type` and `os_image` properties.

Example:

    machine:
      type: e1-standard-2
      os_image: ubuntu1804


### type

The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds.

List of valid values: `e1-standard-2`

Example: `type = e1-standard-2`


### os_image

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.


Valid values: `ubuntu1804`


Example: `os_image = ubuntu1804`



## Preamble example

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:


# Blocks

The `blocks` property is an array of `task` items that hold the elements of a `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file.

The values of the `blocks` property are the tasks of a pipeline as
defined by the `task` property.

If you accidentally name two or more `blocks` items with the same name,
you will get an error message similar to the following:

> semaphore.yml ERROR:

> Error: "There are at least two blocks with same name: Build Go project"


## name

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the Semaphore 2.0 project and is optional.


## task


All the items of a `blocks` list of of the `task` type.

You will learn about the properties of a `task` item in a while.


## Example of Blocks


    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Execute hw.go
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
                - pwd
                - ls -al
                - cat hw.go
                - echo $VAR1
                - echo $PI
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout
          env_vars:
               - name: VAR1
                 value: Environment Variable 1
               - name: PI
                 value: "3.14159"



# Task

The `task` keyword that comes after the `blocks` property divides a YAML configuration file into major and distinct sections. Each `task` item can have multiple `jobs` items, an optional `prologue` section, an optional `epilogue` section as well as an optional `env_vars` block for defining environment variables and an optional `secrets` block for using existing `secrets` environment variables.

### jobs

The `jobs` items of the `blocks` list allow you to define the commands that you want to execute.


### secrets

The `secrets` property is used for using existing `secrets` environment variables.


### prologue

As the `prologue` block is executed before a job, the result of the job that follows that `prologue` block has no effect on the execution of the `prologue` block.


### epilogue

`epilogue` blocks are executed even if the pipeline jobs that precede them have failed.


### env_vars

The elements of an `env_vars` array are name and value pairs that hold the name of the environment variable
and the value of the environment variable, respectively.


#### Example of env_vars


    env_vars:
      - name: VAR1
         value: Environment Variable 1
      - name: PI
         value: "3.14159"


The preceding YAML code exempt defines two environment variables named `VAR1` and `PI`. Both environment variables have string values, which means that numeric values that are not natural numbers need to be included in double quotes.


## Example of task

       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Execute hw.go
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
                - pwd
                - ls -al
                - cat hw.go
                - echo $VAR1
                - echo $PI
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout
          env_vars:
               - name: VAR1
                 value: Environment Variable 1
               - name: PI
                 value: "3.14159"

The indentation level of `prologue`, `epilogue`, `env_vars` and `jobs` properties should be the same.


# Jobs


The `jobs` items are essential for each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline because they allow you to define the actual commands that you want to execute.

## name

The value of the `name` property is a Unicode string that provides a description/name for a particular job. It is considered a good practice to give descriptive names to the jobs and the blocks items of a Semaphore 2.0 pipeline.


## commands

The `commands` property is an array of strings that holds the UNIX commands that will be executed for a job.


### The checkout command

The `checkout` command is a special command offered by Semaphore 2.0 and is used for fetching the files of the GitHub repository into the virtual machine in order to be able to use them.


## cmd_file

the value of the `cmd_file` property is a string that points to a plain text file that can be found in the GitHub repository of your Semaphore 2.0 project.

Semaphore 2.0 reads the plain text file indicated by `cmd_file` and creates the equivalent job using a `commands` block, which is what is finally executed. This means that the `cmd_file` property is replaced before the job is started and a virtual machine begins its execution.

Notice that you cannot use both `commands` and `cmd_file` when defining a job.

### Example of a cmd_file block


    jobs:
      - name: A name for this job
         cmd_file: GitHub/file/plain_text_file


## Example of Jobs


The general structure of a job when using the `commands` property is as follows:

    jobs:
       - name: A name for this job
          commands:
             - Command 1
             - Command 2


The general structure of a job when using the `cmd_file` property is as follows:

    jobs:    
      - name: A name for this job
         cmd_file: path/to/file/plain_text_file



# Prologue and Epilogue


A `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` configuration file can have a single `prologue` and a single `epilogue` property per `task` property. Both `prologue` and `epilogue` properties are optional.


## The Prologue property

A `prologue` block is used when you want to execute some commands prior to a job. This is usually the case with initialization commands that install software, start or stop a service, etc.


## Example of prologue

      prologue:
          commands:
            - checkout

## The Epilogue property


An `epilogue` block should be used when you want to execute some commands after a job has finished, either successfully or unsuccessfully.


## Example of epilogue

      epilogue:
          commands:
            - echo $SEMAPHORE_JOB_RESULT
            - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID

# The secrets property

The `secrets` property is for using existing `secrets` environment variables.

Please notice that when the names of the environment variables of two
more more `secrets` are the same, then the environment variable will
have the value that can be found in the `secrets` property that was
imported last.

Additionally, if you try to use a `name` value that does not exist, the
pipeline will fail to compile and therefore run.


## name

The `name` property is compulsory is a `secrets` block because it
specifies the `secrets` bucket that you want to use. Please note
that the specified `secrets` bucket should be under the
active organization.


## env_var_names

The `env_var_names` property lets you select the environment variables that you want to use from the specified `secrets` bucket. Currently only the `[]` value is accepted, which loads all environment variables found under the specified  `secrets` bucket.


## Example of secrets

      secrets:
        - name: mysql-secrets
          env_var_names: []

Note that the environment variable defined in a `secrets` property are used like regular environment variables defined in a `env_vars` block.

##  A complete .semaphore/semaphore.yml example

The following code presents a complete `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file:

    version: "v1.0"
    name: YAML file example for Go project.
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:
     - name: Inspect Linux environment
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Execute hw.go
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo $HOME
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR
                - pwd
                - ls -al
                - cat hw.go
                - echo $VAR1
                - echo $PI
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout

     - name: Calling text file
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using command_file
              cmd_file: command_file
          prologue:
              commands:
                - checkout

     - name: Build Go project
       task:
          jobs:
            - name: Build hw.go
              commands:
                - checkout
                - sudo apt-get -y install golang-go
                - go build hw.go
                - ls -l ./hw
                - file ./hw
                - ./hw
            - name: PATH variable
              commands:
                - echo $PATH
          epilogue:
              commands:
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_JOB_RESULT
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID


## A .semaphore/semaphore.yml file that uses secrets

    version: "v1.0"
    name: Pipeline configuration with secrets
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804-beta
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
            - name: Using secrets
              commands:
                - checkout
                - ls -l .semaphore
                - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                - echo "Hello World!"
                - echo $SECRET_ONE
                - echo $SECRET_TWO
            - name: Using SECRET_TWO
              commands:
                - checkout
                - echo $SECRET_TWO
                - ls -l .semaphore
          secrets:
            - name: mySecrets
              env_var_names: []
            - name: more-mihalis-secrets
              env_var_names: []

## A .semaphore/semaphore.yml file without name properties

Although it is allowed to have `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` files without
name properties, it is considered a very bad practice and should be
avoided.

However, the following sample `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file proves
that it can be done:

    version: "v1.0"
    name: Basic YAML configuration file example.
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804-beta
    blocks:
      - task:
          jobs:
              - commands:
                 - echo $SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID
                 - echo "Hello World!"


# The order of execution

You cannot and you should not make any assumptions about the order the
various `jobs` of a `task` are going to be executed. This means that the
jobs of each `task` block might not start in the order of definition.

However, the `blocks` items of a `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file, which 
are `task`, are executed sequentially. This means that if you have
two `task` items on a `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file, the second one will
begin only when the first one has finished.

Last, the jobs of a block will run in parallel provided that you have
the required capacity (boxes) available.
