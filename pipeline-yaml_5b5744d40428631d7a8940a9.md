## The preamble

Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.


## The version property

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used.

List of valid values: `"v1.0"`

## The name property

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the pipeline.

*Caution*: The `name` property can be found in other sections because it is used
for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a `task` section defined using `task`.



## The agent property

The `agent` property requires three additional properties that identify the
environment (type of container) in which the jobs of the pipeline will get executed.


### The machine property

The `machine` property holds the `type` and `os_image` properties.

### The type property

The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds.

List of valid values: `e1-standard-2`


#### The e1-standard-2 value

The `e1-standard-2` value represents


### The os_image property

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.


Valid values: `ubuntu1804`


#### The ubuntu1804 value

The `ubuntu1804` value represents


## The blocks property

The values of the `blocks` property are the tasks of a pipeline as defined by the `task` property.


## Preamble example

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:



# Version 2


## The preamble
Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.


## Constants

#### The e1-standard-2 constant

The `e1-standard-2` value represents


#### The ubuntu1804 constant

The `ubuntu1804` value represents



## List of Properties



## version

The `version` property is a string value that shows the version of the
pipeline YAML file that will be used.

List of valid values: `"v1.0"`

Example: `version: "v1.0"`

## name

The `name` property is a Unicode string that assigns a name to the pipeline.

*Caution*: The `name` property can be found in other sections because it is used
for defining the name of a job inside a `jobs` block or the name of
a `task` section defined using `task`.

Example: `name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"`


## agent

The `agent` property requires three additional properties that identify the
environment (type of container) in which the jobs of the pipeline will get executed.

Example:

    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:


### machine

The `machine` property holds the `type` and `os_image` properties.

Example:

    machine:
      type: e1-standard-2
      os_image: ubuntu1804


### type

The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine
(hardware) you would like to use for your builds.

List of valid values: `e1-standard-2`

Example: `type = e1-standard-2`


### os_image

The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and the version of the operation systems that will be used.


Valid values: `ubuntu1804`


Example: `os_image = ubuntu1804`


## blocks

The values of the `blocks` property are the tasks of a pipeline as defined by the `task` property.



## Preamble example

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:

# Version 3

# The preamble

## Introduction
Each Semaphore 2.0 pipeline configuration file has a preamble, which is
mandatory and should be present on every `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file you create.
This is the part of the YAML file where you define important things about the environment
your pipeline will get executed.


### Preamble example

    version: "v1.0"
    name: "The name of the Semaphore 2.0 project"
    agent:
      machine:
        type: e1-standard-2
        os_image: ubuntu1804
    blocks:


# Properties

## The agent property


The fields of the `agent` property are the following:


|   name      |  Description                                                       |
:-----------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------     |
| `machine`   | The `machine` property holds the `type` and `os_image` properties. |
| `type`      | The `type` property is intended for selecting the machine          |
|             | (hardware) you would like to use for your builds.                  |
| `os_image`  | The `os_image` property specifies the operating system and         |
|             | the version of the operation systems that will be used.            |

Valid values for the `os_image` property: `ubuntu1804`

Valid values for the `type` property: `e1-standard-2`
