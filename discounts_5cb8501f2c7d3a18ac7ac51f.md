At Semaphore, we offer discounts for non-profit, student and educational organizations.

## Non-profit discounts

For non-profit organizations, we offer a 25% discount. This means that at the end of each monthly billing cycle your total spending will be discounted at 25% off rate.

If you are eligible for the discount, all you need to do is email us at [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) with a proof of your organization's status, such as the IRS determination letter for US based companies, or its equivalent for other countries.

## Free student accounts

Every student currently enrolled at an accredited high school, college, or university, as well as any learn-to-code program or bootcamp, is eligible for a student account.

Aside from regular $20 free credits per month, students will receive additional $240 gift credits each year, for as long as your studies last.

In order to request a student account, please send us an email to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) from your school-issued email address. In case you don’t have one, please provide some document in order to verify your status of a student.

We will evaluate your request, and get back to you with an answer as soon as possible.

## Free educator accounts

Individual educators currently teaching programming at accredited high schools, colleges, or universities — as well as any learn-to-code programs or bootcamps — are eligible for a free account.

Aside from regular $20 free credits per month, educators will get a certain amount of credits a year, depending on their status.

In order to request educator account, please send us an email to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)  from your .edu email address and/or a document that verifies your status of an educator.

We will evaluate your request, and get back to you with an answer as soon as possible.

## Research discounts

Researchers or collaborators working on a project within an accredited institution whose purpose is related to learning, teaching, and/or training, although may not directly be involved in the teaching process, are eligible for a discount.

To request research discount, please send us an email to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) from your .edu email address and/or a document that verifies your status.
