    yet another test

The `sem` command line tool is used extensively by Semaphore 2.0 for
working with projects, secrets and organizations.

Last, executing the `sem` command line tool without any parameters will
generate the following kind of output:

    $ sem
    Semaphore 2.0 command line interface

    Usage:
      sem [command]

    Available Commands:
      config      Get and set configuration options.
      connect     Connect to a Semaphore endpoint
      context     Manage contexts for connecting to Semaphore
      create      Create a resource from a file.
      delete      Delete a resource.
      describe    Describe a resource
      get         List of resources.
      help        Help about any command
      init        Initialize a project
      version     Display the version

    Flags:
      -h, --help      help for sem
      -v, --verbose   verbose output

    Use "sem [command] --help" for more information about a command.

The  `-v` parameter can be very handy when you have problems with
the `sem` command.
