With Semaphore 2.0 you will only pay for what you used and you can customize
your usage according to your team's needs.

## Trial Period

Once you sign up, you can choose between a **Free plan** and a **Trial**. The
trial period lasts 14 days. During the trial, you can use
[the default machine quota](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/133-quotas-and-limits)
completely free of charge.

Of course, you can easily scale up if you need a bigger capacity by going to
**Billing > See detailed insights… > Quota > Request upgrade…** or by reaching
out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)
(please include which type of machine you prefer).

## Plans

After your trial period expires, your organization will be blocked and you will
be prompted to choose a **Free plan** or a **Paid plan**.

The **Free plan** includes $10 of free credit per calendar month. At the
beginning of each month, you will receive a new $10 credit for your
organization. On this plan, you will be able to run 1 job and you can use the
e1-standard-2
[machine](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types#linux-machine-types).
You can have an unlimited number of organizations, but only one of the
organizations you own can be on a free plan.

The **Paid plan** is activated once you add your credit card. You will be
charged based on your usage at the beginning of each month for the previous
month. Billing cycles are based on calendar months.

Every organization has a set of quotas that define the maximum number of
parallel running jobs. You can see those numbers on the
[Quotas and limits](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/133-quotas-and-limits)
page. Refer to
[Machine types](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types)
page for more information about available hardware you can use.

If you are on a **paid plan** or in **trial** and you’d like to run more jobs in
parallel than given by default, you can easily scale up by reaching out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)
(please include which type of machine you prefer) or through the Semaphore 2.0
UI (Billing > See detailed insights… > Quota > Request upgrade…).

In Semaphore 2.0 all organizations are on monthly plans.

**Note:** If you currently have an annual subscription on Semaphore Classic and
would like to migrate to 2.0, please reach out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Billing page

Billing page is accessible to the creator of the organization and admins and you
can find it in the Owner’s area of your organization.

Here you can find all the details related to your usage:

1. [Machine types](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types)
2. [Prices](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing) of each machine in dollars per
second
3. Number of seconds each machine was used
4. Spendings (per machine and total)

**Note:** To see the fully updated usage, you should allow for up to
24h to pass.

## Billing insights

The organization owner and admins can see usage in more details by clicking on
**See detailed insights…** in the top right corner of the Billing page. Here
you can find:

- Daily spending chart which contains spending per machine type. This data is
available for any selected period.
- Quota chart which contains the maximal number of machines running at the same
time. This data is available for the current and previous months.
- Top spending projects.

## Budget alert

Organization owner and admins can set up budget alerts. An email notification
will be sent, to the organization's owner email address, when you spend 50%, 90%
and 100% of your budget within one month's spending. However, pipelines won't be
disabled once you go past the budget.

You can set a budget alert through the Semaphore 2.0 UI (Billing > Set budget…)
when the organization is on a paid plan.

## Upgrading to a paid plan

To upgrade to a paid plan, go to the Billing page and click on
**Upgrade to remove the limit** button in the top right corner. After that,
enter your credit card information and that’s it.

## Invoices

You will receive an invoice for your organization at the end of every billing
period to the email address you entered while adding your credit card.

If you want to change the recipient name, company name, address, phone number,
billing email, VAT ID or country on the invoice, please contact us at
[support@semaphoreci.com](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com).
