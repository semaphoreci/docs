With Semaphore 2.0 you will only pay for what you actually used and you can
customize your usage according to your team's needs.

## Plans

Once you sign up and create an organization, you are automatically on a
**free plan**. With this plan, you will get $20 free credit every 30 days for
the first organization you create on Semaphore 2.0. If needed, an owner of 
the organization can request a transfer of $20 free credit to another organization
he owns by reaching out to [support@semaphoreci.com](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com).

If you decide to add your credit card, you will be switched to the
**paid plan**. Once you do that, you won’t be charged anything. The first
charge will happen at the end of the billing period which are 30 days long
starting from the moment you created an organization. When you add your credit
card, you will receive $200 gift credit for your organization that you can use
during a 3-month period.

Every organization has a set of quotas that define the maximum number of parallel running jobs.
You can see those numbers on the [Quotas and limits](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/133-quotas-and-limits) page.
Refer to [Machine types](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types) page for more information about available hardware you can use.

If you are on a **paid plan** and you’d like to run more jobs in parallel
than given by default, you can easily scale up by reaching out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com) (please include which type of 
machine you prefer) or through the Semaphore 2.0 UI (Billing > See detailed insights… > Quota > Request upgrade…).

In Semaphore 2.0 all organizations are on monthly plans.

**Note:** If you currently have an annual subscription on Semaphore Classic and
would like to migrate to 2.0, please reach out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Billing page

Billing page is accessible to the creator of an organization and admins and you can
find it in the Owner’s area of your organization.

Here you can find all the details related to your usage:

1. [Machine types](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types)
2. [Prices](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing) of each machine in dollars per second
3. Number of seconds each machine was used
4. Spendings (per machine and total)

**Note:** In order to see fully updated usage, you should allow for up to
24h to pass.

Your current month's running total is always reduced by $20 you get each month
for your first organization. If you have any discounts, your running total will
be reduced by that, too.

## Billing insights

Organization owner and admins can see usage in more details by clicking on
**See detailed insights…** in the top right corner of the Billing page. Here
you can find:

- Daily spending chart which contains spending per machine type. This data is 
available for any selected period.
- Quota chart which contains maximal number of machines running at the same time. 
This data is available for current and previous month.
- Top spending projects.

## Budget Limits

Organization owner and admins can setup budget limits. Email notification will be sent when you spend 50%, 90% and 100% of your budget. However, pipelines won't be disabled once you go past the budget.

Budget limit can be set through the Semaphore 2.0 UI (Billing > Set budget…) when Organization is on a paid plan.

## Upgrading to a paid plan

In order to upgrade to a paid plan, go to the Billing page and click on
**Add Card and get $200…** button in the top right corner. After that, enter
your credit card information and that’s it.

## Invoices

You will receive an invoice for your organization at the end of every billing
period to the email address you entered while adding your credit card.

If you want to change the recipient name, company name, address, phone number,
billing email or country on the invoice, please contact us at
[support@semaphoreci.com](mailto:support@semaphoreci.com).
