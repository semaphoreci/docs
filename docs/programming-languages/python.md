# Python

This guide will help you get started with a Python project on Semaphore.
If youâ€™re new to Semaphore please read our
[Guided tour](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/77-getting-started) first.

## Hello world

```yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Python example
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804
blocks:
  - name: Hello world
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run some code
          commands:
            - python -c 'print("evol"[::-1])'
```

## Django example

Semaphore provides a tutorial with a working
CI/CD pipeline that you can use to get started quickly:

- [Django Continuous Integration tutorial][django-tutorial]

## Supported Python versions

Semaphore supports all versions of Python. You have the following options:

- Linux: Python is available out-of-the-box in the [Ubuntu 18.04 VM image][ubuntu-python].
- macOS: Python is available out-of-the-box in the [macOS VM image][macos-python].
- Docker: use [semaphoreci/python][python-docker-image] or
  [your own Docker image][docker-env] with the version of Python and other
  packages that you need.

Follow the links above for details on currently available language versions and
additional tools.

#### Selecting a Python version on Linux

On Linux, you can use the [`sem-version` tool][sem-version] to switch between
Python versions. For example:

```
sem-version python 3.7
```

If the version of Python that you need is not currently available in the Linux VM,
we recommend running your jobs in [a custom Docker image][docker-env].

## Dependency caching

### Caching Pip Downloads

You can use Semaphore's `cache` command to store and load a pip
download cache directory. This does not cache the installations, just
the downloads but it will speed up builds significantly. Here's an
example:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          # Add --local pip bin to $PATH
          - export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
          - checkout
          - mkdir .pip_cache
          - cache restore
          # Use --user to avoid permission conflicts
          - pip install --user --cache-dir .pip_cache -r requirements.txt
          - cache store
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - py.test
```

### Pipenv

You can use Semaphore's `cache` command to store and load `pipenv`'s
virtualenv. This requires setting the `PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT`
environment variable.
In the following configuration example, we install dependencies
and warm the cache in the first block, then use the cache in subsequent blocks.

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Python Example
agent:
 machine:
   type: e1-standard-2
   os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
 - name: Install dependencies
   task:
     env_vars:
       - name: PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT
         value: "true"
     prologue:
       commands:
         - sudo pip install pipenv
         - checkout
     jobs:
       - name: Install and cache dependencies
         commands:
           - cache restore pipenv-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Pipfile.lock),pipenv-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH,pipenv-master
           # --deploy also checks python version requirements
           - pipenv install --dev --deploy
           - cache store pipenv-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Pipfile.lock) .venv
 - name: Tests
   task:
     env_vars:
       - name: PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT
         value: "true"
     prologue:
       commands:
         - sudo pip install pipenv
         - checkout
         - cache restore cache restore pipenv-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Pipfile.lock),pipenv-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH,pipenv-master
     jobs:
       - name: Everything
         commands:
           # assuming you have "test" in your Pipfile scripts
           - pipenv run test
```

If you need to clear cache for your project, launch a
[debug session](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/75-debugging-with-ssh-access)
and execute `cache clear` or `cache delete <key>`.

## Environment Variables

Semaphore doesn't set project specific environment variables like
`TESTING` used in Flask. You can set these at the task level.

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      env_vars:
        - name: TESTING
          value: "1"
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - python test.py
```

## C-Extensions & system dependencies

Projects may need system packages in order to install pips like `postgres`.
Semaphore provides full `sudo` access so you may install all required packages.
Here's an example of installing the `postgres` pip:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y libpq-dev
          - pip install postgres
      jobs:
        - name: Everything
          commands:
            - python test.py
```
