# Rust

This guide will help you get started with a Rust project on Semaphore.
If youâ€™re new to Semaphore, we recommend reading our
_[Guided tour](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/guided-tour/getting-started/)_ first.

## Hello World

``` yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Rust example
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
  containers:
    - name: main
      image: semaphoreci/rust:1.35
blocks:
  - name: Hello world
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: Compile and run code
        commands:
          - printf 'fn main() { println!("Hello World!"); }' > hello.rs && rustc hello.rs
          - ./hello
```
!!! info "Docker Hub rate limits"
    Please note that due to the introduction of the [rate limits](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/download-rate-limit/) on Docker Hub, for your convenience, any compose style pulls from the `semaphoreci` Docker Hub repository will automatically be redirected to [Semaphore registry](/ci-cd-environment/semaphore-registry-images/). This means that you will not have to [authenticate](/ci-cd-environment/docker-authentication/) in order to pull such images.

## Supported Rust Versions

Semaphore supports all versions of Rust. To run Rust programs you should define
[a Docker-based agent][docker-env] using one of the available Rust images,
or build your own container image that matches your needs.

For more information about pre-built Rust images provided by Semaphore, see
[semaphoreci/rust](/ci-cd-environment/semaphore-registry-images/#rust) documentation page.
