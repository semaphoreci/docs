# Go

This guide covers configuring Golang projects on Semaphore.
If youâ€™re new to Semaphore we recommend reading the
[Guided tour](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/77-getting-started) first.

## Hello world

```yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Go example
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804
blocks:
  - name: Hello world
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Run Go
          commands:
            - go version
```

## Example project

Semaphore provides a tutorial and example Go application with a working
CI pipeline that you can use to get started quickly:

- [Golang Continuous Integration tutorial][go-tutorial]
- [Demo project on GitHub][go-demo-project]

## Supported Go versions

Semaphore supports all versions of Go. You have the following options:

- Linux: Go is available out-of-the-box in the [Ubuntu 18.04 VM image][ubuntu-go].
- Docker: use [semaphoreci/golang][go-docker-image] or
  [your own Docker image][docker-env] with the version of Go and other
  packages that you need.

Follow the links above for details on currently available language versions and
additional tools.

#### Selecting a Go version on Linux

The [Linux VM][ubuntu1804] provides multiple versions of Go.
You can switch between them using the [`sem-version` tool][sem-version].

For example, in your `semaphore.yml`:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - sem-version go 1.12
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - go version
```

If the version of Go that you need is not currently available in the Linux VM,
we recommend running your jobs in [a custom Docker image][docker-env].

## Using GOPATH

If you are not using Go 1.11 then you will need to prepare the directory
structure Go tooling expects. This requires creating `$GOPATH/src` and
cloning your code into the correct directory. This is possible by changing some
environment variables and using the existing Semaphore 2.0 toolbox.

``` yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yml
version: v1.0
name: Go Example
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Test
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          - export "SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR=$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/${SEMAPHORE_PROJECT_NAME}"
          - export "PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}"
          - mkdir -vp "${SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR}" "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
      jobs:
        - name: Test Suite
          commands:
            # Uses the redefined SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR to clone code into the correct directory
            - checkout
            # Further setup from this point on
```

## Dependency Caching

Go projects use multiple approaches to dependency management. If you are using
`dep` then the strategy is similar to other projects.

After downloading `dep`, you should use the `cache` utility to store and
restore the directory you put your source code files, which for the purposes
of this document will be named `vendor`.

You can download and install `dep` as follows:

``` bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
```

You can initialize the cache as follows:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Warm cache
    task:
      prologue:
        commands:
          # Go project boiler plate
          - export "SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR=$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/${SEMAPHORE_PROJECT_NAME}"
          - export "PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}"
          - mkdir -vp "${SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR}" "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
          # Dep install db
          - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
          - checkout
      jobs:
        - name:
          commands:
            - cache restore deps-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gopkg.lock),deps-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH,deps-master
            - dep ensure -v
            - cache store deps-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gopkg.lock) vendor
```

After that you can reuse that cache as follows:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - name: Tests
      prologue:
        commands:
          # Go project boiler plate
          - export "SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR=$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/${SEMAPHORE_PROJECT_NAME}"
          - export "PATH=$(go env GOPATH)/bin:${PATH}"
          - mkdir -vp "${SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR}" "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
          # Dep install db
          - curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golang/dep/master/install.sh | sh
          - checkout
          - cache restore deps-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH-$(checksum Gopkg.lock),deps-$SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH,deps-master
      jobs:
        - name: Suite
          commands:
            - make test
```
