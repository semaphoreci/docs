# Clojure

This guide covers configuring Clojure projects on Semaphore.
If youâ€™re new to Semaphore we recommend reading the
[Guided tour](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/77-getting-started) first.

## Supported Clojure versions

Semaphore 2.0 Virtual Machine comes with the Leiningen tool preinstalled. The
name of the binary executable is `lein`, which is what will be used in the
Semaphore 2.0 project presented in this page.

## Changing Clojure version

The version of Clojure that is going to be used on a project generated by
Leiningen depends on the contents of the `project.clj` file that can be found
in the root directory of each Leiningen project. Therefore there is no need for
executing a specific command in order to change the current Clojure version.

## Dependency management

You can use Semaphore's [cache tool](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/54-toolbox-reference#cache)
to store and load any files or Clojure libraries that you want to reuse between jobs.

## System dependencies

Clojure projects might need packages like database drivers. As you have full `sudo`
access on each Semaphore 2.0 VM, you are free to install all required packages.

## A sample Clojure project

The following `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` file illustrates how to execute two
Clojure projects created using the Leiningen tool:

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Clojure Language Guide
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Lein version
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: Print lein version
        commands:
          - lein version

  - name: Compile with Clojure 1.9.0
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: Hello World 1.9.0
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd one
          - lein run

  - name: Compile with Clojure 1.10.0
    task:
      jobs:
      - name: Hello World 1.10.0
        commands:
          - checkout
          - cd two
          - lein run
```

For the `one` project the contents of `project.clj` are as follows:

``` clojure
(defproject hw "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :main one.core
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.9.0"]])
```

This is the place where you specify the Clojure version you want to use for
your project, which in this case is 1.9.0.

For the `two` project the contents of `project.clj` are as follows:

``` clojure
(defproject hw "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :main two.core
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.10.0"]])
```

Again, this is the place where you specify the Clojure version you want to use
for your project, which in this case is 1.10.0.

To sum up, project `one` uses Clojure version 1.9.0 whereas project `two` uses
Clojure version 1.10.0.

The contents of the `./src/one/core.clj` file from the `one` project are as
follows:

``` clojure
(ns one.core)

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello World!")
  (println "Clojure 1.9.0"))
```

The contents of the `./src/two/core.clj` file from the `two` project are as
follows:

``` clojure
(ns two.core)

(defn -main [& args]
  (println "Hello World!")
  (println "Clojure 1.10.0!"))
```
