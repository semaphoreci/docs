# Swift

Semaphore allows the building, testing, and releasing of Swift, Objective-C, and
React Native applications with customizable CI/CD workflows.

If youâ€™re new to Semaphore, we recommend reading our
[guided tour](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/guided-tour/getting-started/) first.

The macOS Xcode 14 and maxOS Xcode 15 images are available with a full complement of useful tools and 
utilities pre-installed. Information regarding the exact version numbers of macOS, 
Xcode, fastlane, CocoaPods, and all other tools is found below:

* [macOS Xcode 14 Image](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/macos-xcode-14-image/)
* [macOS Xcode 15 Image](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/macos-xcode-15-image/)

> **WARNING: The macOS Xcode 14 OS image will be deprecated on September 30, 2024. Please update to the newer [macOS Xcode 15](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/macos-xcode-15-image/) image.**

# Configuring continuous integration

Below is a minimal `semaphore.yml` file, which starts an
[Xcode 14 image](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/ci-cd-environment/macos-xcode-14-image/) 
and runs `xcodebuild`:

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Semaphore iOS Swift example
agent:
  machine:
    type: a1-standard-4
    os_image: macos-xcode14
blocks:
  - name: Build
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Checkout and build
          commands:
            - checkout
            - xcodebuild
```

## Example project

Semaphore maintains an [example project](https://github.com/semaphoreci-demos/semaphore-demo-ios-swift-xcode) built with Swift and SwiftUI that demonstrates how to build an app and run tests. A
[full tutorial showing how to configure an iOS project for CI with Semaphore](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/examples/ios-continuous-integration-with-xcode/)
is also available.
