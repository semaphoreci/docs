# Deployment Dashboards

This guide shows you how to set up a dashboard showing deployment activity
across selected projects.
Before starting, [create a new Semaphore project][create-project]
along with one or more [delivery pipelines][promotions-guide].

Start by creating a blank dashboard using the [sem CLI][sem-ref]:

``` bash
$ sem create dashboard demo-deployment
Dashboard 'demo-deployment' created.
```

Open the dashboard configuration:

``` bash
sem edit dashboard demo-deployment
```

At this point you have the dashboard definition open in your default editor.
It looks something like this:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Dashboard
metadata:
  name: demo-deployment
  title: demo-deployment
  id: d0013e29-e4f9-43a6-9322-b5d843accd7d
  create_time: "1543855505"
  update_time: "1543855839"
spec:
  widgets: []
```

Recall that deployment is typically a separate pipeline which gets triggered
by a promotion. Because of that, to make the dashboard display deployment
activities, we need to use the
[pipelines list type of a dashboard][pipelines-dashboard].

The minimal configuration would be as follows:

``` yaml
spec:
  widgets:
  - name: Deploys to production
    type: list_pipelines
    filters:
      pipeline_file: .semaphore/production-deployment.yml
      project_id: 5e99069f-0be6-4b60-85a1-4cbcfc5f339a
```

With the configuration above, dashboard will display all activities in the
`.semaphore/production-deployment.yml` pipeline on any branch.

To find the ID of your project, execute `sem get projects`, then
`sem get project <projectname>`.

That's it! Once you save the file and exit your editor, sem will automatically
update the dashboard definition. When you open Semaphore, you will find
the link to your dashboard in the sidebar on the left-hand side.

A dashboard can apply additional conditions and display data from more than one
source. For more information, consult the
