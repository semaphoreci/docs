# Dashboards YAML Reference

This document is the reference of the Dashboard YAML grammar used for
defining `dashboards` in Semaphore 2.0.

A Semaphore 2.0 `Dashboard` is a place where you can define `widgets` in order
to overview the operations that take place under the current Semaphore 2.0
organization.

More specifically, a `widget` is used for watching the activity of pipelines
and workflows according to certain criteria that are defined using filters
that can help you narrow down the displayed information.

Each dashboard is associated to a given organization. Therefore, in order to
view a specific dashboard you should be connected to the organization the
dashboard belongs to.

## Properties

This section will present all the properties of the Dashboard YAML grammar
except the `widgets` property and the properties that exist under the `widgets`
property, which are presented in the [widgets](#widgets) section.

### apiVersion

The `apiVersion` property specifies the API version of the Dashboard YAML
grammar that will be used in the current document. Different API versions
might have different features.

The list of valid values for `apiVersion`: `v1alpha`.

### kind

The `kind` property defines the purpose of the YAML file. For a YAML file that
will be used for defining a Dashboard, the value of the `kind` property should
be `Dashboard`.

The list of valid values for `kind`: `Dashboard`.

### metadata

The `metadata` property defines the metadata of the Dashboard YAML file.
The list of supported properties includes `name`, `title`, `id`,
`create_time` and `update_time` but this might change in future versions.

#### name in metadata

The `name` property holds the name of the dashboard as it will appear in the
URL of the dashboard and should be unique among the dashboards of an
organization.

The value of `value` should contain lowercase letters, dashes and numbers only.

#### title in metadata

The `title` property holds the title of the Dashboard as it will appear in the
UI of Semaphore 2.0 and it can contain Unicode characters.

#### id

The value of the `id` property is automatically generated and assigned by
Semaphore 2.0 and is unique among all dashboards. It should not be edited.

#### create_time

The value of the `create_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. It holds the time of creation of the
dashboard.

#### update_time

The value of the `update_time` property is automatically generated by Semaphore
2.0 and is in the UNIX epoch format. This value is automatically updated each
time you make changes to a dashboard.

### spec

The `spec` property is currently used for holding the `widgets` property.

## Widgets

The `widgets` property holds the list of widgets of a dashboard. Each widget
defines the actual information that will be displayed on Semaphore 2.0 UI using
the `name`, `type` and `filters` properties.

### The filters property

The `filters` property holds a list of items that can help you filter the
output to match certain criteria.

### name in widgets

The `name` property used in each list item of the `widgets` property defines
the name of the `widget` as it will appear on the UI of Semaphore 2.0.

### type

The value of `type` defines whether you want your widget to display information
about pipelines or workflows.

The list of valid values for `type`: `list_workflows` and `list_pipelines`.

### Workflows list

In order to create a workflows list you will need to use `list_workflows` as
the value of the `type` property. A workflows list displays information about
workflows.

The supported properties in `filters` for a workflows list are the following:

- **project_id** (optional): allows to display workflows from a given Semaphore
  2.0 project. You can find the project ID of an existing Semaphore 2.0 project
  using the `sem get project <name>` command.

- **branch** (optional): The `branch` property allows you to filter the widget
  output by the branch name of the GitHub repository of a Semaphore 2.0
  project. Note that the value of the `branch` property should be an exact
  match and that there is currently no support for regular expressions in the
  `branch` property.

- **github_uid** (optional): The `github_uid` property allows you to display
  workflows that were initiated by a specific GitHub user. The value of
  `github_uid` should correspond to the numeric ID of the user account on
  GitHub for which we want to list workflows. The value can be found by
  visiting the following URL <https://api.github.com/users/USERNAME> and
  replacing `USERNAME` with an actual GitHub username. There is a special
  value for the `github_uid` property, which is `'{{github_uid}}'`, that is
  automatically expanded to the GitHub user ID of the user that is visiting the
  page.

If you are using a `list_worflows` type and you have no filters, the value of
`filters` should be `filters: {}`.

#### Workflows example

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Dashboard
metadata:
  name: my-dashboard
  title: My Dashboard
  id: eb0cc2c7-bbc9-41e4-9e3d-2eb622a673fb
  create_time: "1537888191"
  update_time: "1537889560"
spec:
  widgets:
  - name: Master branch from all projects
    type: list_workflows
    filters:
      branch: master
  - name: All projects on the current organization
    type: list_workflows
    filters: {}
```

### Pipelines list

In order to create a pipelines list you will need to use `list_pipelines` as
the value of the `type` property. A pipelines list displays information about
pipelines.

The supported properties in `filters` for a pipelines list are the following:

- **project_id** (required): restricts the widget output to pipelines from a
  single Semaphore 2.0 project. You can find the project ID of an existing
  Semaphore 2.0 project using the `sem get project <name>` command.

- **branch** (optional): The `branch` property allows you to filter the widget
  output by the specified branch name of the GitHub repository of the Semaphore
  2.0 project. Note that the value of the `branch` property should be an exact
  match and that there is currently no support for regular expressions in the
  `branch` property.

- **pipeline_file** (optional): the `pipeline_file` property allows you to
  filter the generated output using the filename of the pipeline file that is
  being executed. Please note that the `pipeline_file` value should not be just
  the name of the pipeline file but the full path starting from the root
  directory of the GitHub repository. Therefore, the filename of the default
  pipeline is `.semaphore/semaphore.yml`.

#### Pipelines example

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1alpha
kind: Dashboard
metadata:
  name: my-dashboard
  title: My Dashboard
  id: eb0cc2c7-bbc9-41e4-9e3d-2eb622a673fb
  create_time: "1537445699"
  update_time: "1537445713"
spec:
  widgets:
  - name: Pipelines
    type: list_pipelines
    filters:
      project_id: 7384612f-e22f-4710-9f0f-5dcce85ba44b
      branch: demo
      pipeline_file: .semaphore/p1.yml
  - name: docs project pipelines
    type: list_pipelines
    filters:
      project_id: 0dd982e8-32f5-4037-983e-4de01ac7fb1e
```
