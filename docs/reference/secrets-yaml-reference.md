# Secrets YAML Reference

This document is the reference for the YAML grammar used for creating secrets.

A `secret` is a bucket that stores environment variables and files.

A secret along with its contents is created under the current organization and
is available in this organization only unless you add it to other
organizations. Additionally, a secret is visible to all the users of an
organization.

## Properties

### apiVersion

The `apiVersion` property defines the version of the YAML grammar that will be
used in the current YAML file. Different versions might have different
features.

The list of values for `apiVersion`: `v1beta`.

### kind

The `kind` property defines the purpose of the YAML file. For a YAML file that
will be used for defining secrets, the value of the `kind` property should
be `Secret`.

The list of values for `kind`: `Secret`.

### metadata

The `metadata` property defines the metadata of the Secrets YAML file.
Currently, only the `name` property is allowed but this might change
in future versions.

#### name in metadata

The value of the `name` property, which is a string, in the `metadata` context
defines the name of the secret. This `name` value will be used in
the Pipeline YAML file for importing a specific secret or as an
argument to the `sem delete secret` command for deleting a specific secret.

The value of each `name` property should be unique among all secrets
that exist under the same organization and must only contain [a-z], [A-Z] or
[0-9] characters, dashes and underscores – space characters are not allowed.

### data

The `data` property, which is compulsory and should not be empty, holds a
single `env_vars` property and/or a single `files` property.

### env_vars

The `env_vars` property is a list of `name` and `value` pairs that allows you
to define the names and the values of the environment variables that will be
inserted in the current secret.

#### name in env_vars

The value of the `name` property under the `env_vars` property defines the
name of an environment variable.

The name of an environment variable should follow
[these guidelines](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/000095399/basedefs/xbd_chap08.html).

#### value

The value of the `value` property defines the value of the environment variable
that was previously defined using a `name` property.

### files

The `files` property holds a list of items with `path` and `content` pairs and
is used for storing files in `secrets`.

#### path

The `path` property holds the name of the file that will be stored – this
value defines the way the file is going to be referenced and restored in the
future and should not exist in the GitHub repository.

#### content

The `content` property holds the contents of the file that will be referenced
by the value of the `path` property. The data of the `content` field is in
-Base64 representation-.

## Example

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1beta
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: a-secret-name
data:
  env_vars:
    - name: SECRET_ONE
      value: "This is the value of SECRET_ONE"
    - name: SECRET_TWO
      value: "This is the value of SECRET_TWO"
```

The previous example defines a secret named `a-secrets-name`
that contains two environment variables named `SECRET_ONE` and
`SECRET_TWO` with values `This is the value of SECRET_ONE` and
`This is the value of SECRET_TWO`, respectively.

The example is equivalent to the previous one:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1beta
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: a-secret-name
data:
  env_vars:
    - name: SECRET_ONE
      value: "This is the value of SECRET_ONE"
    - name: SECRET_TWO
      value: "This is the value of SECRET_TWO"
  files: []
```

## Example with files

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1beta
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secrets
data:
  env_vars:
  - name: SECRET_ONE
    value: This is a little secret
  files:
  - path: file.txt
    content: SGVsbG8gU2VtYXBob3JlIDIuMAo=
```

The data in the `content` field is the output of the `base64 file.txt` command
because the contents of the file are in Base64 representation.

## Example with an empty secret

If you want to create an `empty` secret you can define the `data` block as
follows:

``` yaml
apiVersion: v1beta
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: empty-secret
data:
  env_vars: []
  files: []
```
