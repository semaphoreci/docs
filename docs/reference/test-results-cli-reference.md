# Test results CLI Reference

The `test-results` command line interface (CLI) is a tool that helps you compile and
process JUnit test result XML files for [Test Summary&nbsp;↗][test-summary-essentials] pages.

The is open-sourced and available on [GitHub&nbsp;↗](https://github.com/semaphoreci/test-results). You can access the source code, contribute, and report issues there.

`test-results` have a built-in help command that can be accessed by running the following:

```
$ test-results

Semaphore 2.0 Test results CLI v0.4.5

Usage:
  test-results [command]

Available Commands:
  combine             combines multiples json summary files into one file
  compile             parses xml files to a well-defined json schema
  gen-pipeline-report fetches workflow level junit reports and combines them
  help                Help with commands
  publish             parses xml file to a well-defined json schema and publishes results to artifacts storage

Flags:
      --config string         config file (default is $HOME/.test-results.yaml)
  -h, --help                  help for test-results
  -N, --name string           name of the suite
  -p, --parser string         override parser to be used (default "auto")
  -S, --suite-prefix string   prefix for each suite
  -t, --toggle                Help message for toggle
      --trace                 trace output
  -v, --verbose               verbose output
      --version               version for test-results

Use "test-results [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Merging test results

Let's say that your job generates multiple JUnit xml files:

```shell
$ tree /tmp/test-results
/tmp/test-results
├── benchmark.xml
├── integration.xml
├── ui.xml
└── unit.xml

0 directories, 4 files
```

If you want to have a single report for the job, you can use the following command:

```shell
test-results publish /tmp/test-results
```

This will combine all `.xml` files into one report and then publish it to your artifacts storage.

## Working with docker

When you run your test suites from a docker container, generated JUnit XML files will only be available in that container by default.
In order to make the host aware of these files, you can use [docker bind mounts&nbsp;↗][docker-bind-mounts]:

```yaml
# .semaphore/semaphore.yaml
- name: Run tests
  task:
    prologue:
      commands:
        - checkout
        # Creates `test-runner` image
        - bin/setup.sh
    jobs:
    - name: go test
      commands:
        # `run-specs` creates `junit.xml` file in container's /app directory
        - docker run -v $(pwd):/app test-runner run-specs

    epilogue:
      always:
        commands:
          - test-results publish junit.xml
```
