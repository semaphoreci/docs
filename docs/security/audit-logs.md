!!! plans "Available on: <span class="plans-box">Scaleup</span>"

To support compliance, accountability, and security, Semaphore provides logs of audited events. Audit Log [events][events] are events that affect your organization, projects, users, or any other [resources][resources] in Semaphore.
Events contain information about when who and what was the performed activity. 

You can find audit logs in your organization settings under Audit Logs.
