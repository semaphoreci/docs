# Configure OpenID Connect in Google Cloud

!!! plans "Available on: <span class="plans-box">Scaleup</span>"

Open ID Connect allows your pipelines to access resources in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) without
the need to store long-lived access credentials in secrets.

In this guide, you will learn how to configure Google Cloud Workload Identity Provider to trust
Semaphore OIDC as a federated identity and then to access cloud resources from your Semaphore
Pipelines.

## Adding a Google Cloud Workload Identity Provider

To configure OIDC identity provider in GCP, you will perform the following actions:

1. Create a new identity pool.
2. Configure the mapping and conditions.
3. Connect the pool with a Google Cloud service account.

In this guide, we will use the [gcloud][gcloud] command line utility to set up and configure the
connection between GCP and Semaphore. Refer to the [Google Cloud Identity Federation documentation][gcp-identity-docs]
for further details and alternative approaches for setting up the connection.

### Creating a new identity pool

Create a new identity pool by executing the following snippet.

``` bash
export POOL_ID="<unique-pool-name>" // example: semaphoreci-com-identity-pool

gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create $POOL_ID \
  --location="global" \
  --description="Identity pool for SemaphoreCI" \
  --display-name=$POOL_ID
```

### Configure mappings and conditions

In this step, we are going to map fields from a Semaphore OIDC token to Google attributes, and then
set up conditions under which the token is able to access the identity pool.

The combination of mappings and conditions is a powerful technique that allows you to set up various
levels of access policies. To use the full power of this mechanism, refer to the Google Cloud documentation
on [attribute mapping][gcloud-attr-mapping] and [condition mapping][gcloud-condition-mapping].

In the following example, you will see how to configure Google Cloud to allow access to a previously-created
identity pool from the `main` branch of the `web` project.

``` bash
export PROVIDER_ID="<unique-provider-name>" // example: semaphoreci-com-web
export ISSUER_URI="https://{org-name}.semaphoreci.com" // set this to your full organization path, ex. https://acme.semapohoreci.com

gcloud iam workload-identity-pools providers create-oidc $PROVIDER_ID \
  --location='global' \
  --workload-identity-pool=$POOL_ID \
  --issuer-uri="$ISSUER_URI" \
  --allowed-audiences="$ISSUER_URI" \
  --attribute-mapping='google.subject="semaphore::" + assertion.repo + "::" + assertion.ref' \
  --attribute-condition="'semaphore::web::refs/heads/main' == google.subject"
```

### Connect the pool with a service account

When connecting to Google Cloud, your pipelines impersonate a Google Cloud Service Account.
To set up which service account is accessible via the previously-configured Workload Identity pool,
we need to set up a link between the workload identity user and the service account.

First, construct the member id based on the following parameters:

``` bash
# Based on the previous step in this guide. Ajudst based on your needs.
export SUBJECT="semaphore::web::refs/heads/main"

# Your Google Cloud Project ID.
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $(gcloud config get-value core/project) --format=value\(projectNumber\))

# The member ID
export MEMBER_ID="principal://iam.googleapis.com/projects/$PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/subject/$SUBJECT"
```

Then, bind the workload identity user to a service account.

``` bash
export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL="<>" # ID of the service account who you want to impersonate in the pipelines

gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding $SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL \
    --role=roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser \
    --member="MEMBER_ID"
```

in Google Cloud docs.

## Authenticate with Google Cloud from your Semaphore pipelines

Set up the following steps in your Semaphore pipelines in order to authenticate with Google Cloud Platform
and to obtain short-lived credentials for accessing resources.

``` yaml
version: v1.0
name: Example auth with OIDC
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004

blocks:
  - name: "Auth to Google Cloud"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: 'Auth Test Job'
          commands:
            - export POOL_ID="" # set your pool id
            - export PROVIDER_ID="" # set your provider name
            - export PROJECT_ID="" # set your google cloud project id
            - export SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL="" # set your service account's email
            - export POOL_URI="projects/$PROJECT_ID/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/$POOL_ID/providers/$PROVIDER_ID"
            - echo $SEMAPHORE_OIDC_TOKEN > /tmp/oidc_token
            - gcloud iam workload-identity-pools create-cred-config $POOL_URI --service-account="$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL" --service-account-token-lifetime-seconds=600 --output-file=/home/semaphore/creds.json --credential-source-file=/tmp/oidc_token --credential-source-type="text"
            - export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/home/semaphore/creds.json
            - gcloud auth login --cred-file=/home/semaphore/creds.json
            - gcloud projects list
```
