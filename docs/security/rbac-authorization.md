# Rbac model

Semaphore 2.0 uses a role-based access control model for user authorization. This page will document all existing permissions, roles,
and how to manage them.

## Roles on Semaphore

All of the roles (and permissions) within the Semaphore are devided into <i>organization-level</i> and <i>project-level</i>.
<i>Organization-level</i> roles define access to functionalities and assets that apply to the entire organization (Audit Logs, Billing, 
Organization Members, Projects, etc.).
On the other hand, <i>project-level</i> roles are assigned within a single project, and grant access to information scoped only to that one
project (Schedulers, Insights, Workflows, Artifacts). To get any project-level role, you have to be a part of the organization
which owns that project (you must have a role within the organization).

## Role Management

Users can get roles in a few different ways (from different sources):
<ul>
<li>Each user can get one organization role assigned to them directly (from the organization's Admin or Owner).</li>
<li>User can get an organization-level role from membership within one (or more) organization groups.</li>
</ul>

Within each project user can be assigned a role:
<ul>
<li>Directly form projects Admin or Maintainer.</li>
<li>From membership within one (or more) organization groups.</li>
<li>From access rights within [project's repository](#repository-to-role-mappings) (GitHub or BitBucket).</li>
<li>From the role that user has [within the organization](#organization-role-to-project-role-mappings).</li>
</ul>

TODO Picture from UI for assigning roles/viewing role assignments

### Repository to role mappings

If an organization member (someone who has any role within the organization) also has access to the projects
remote repository on GitHub or BitBucket, that member will be assigned a role within the project automatically.

<b>Pull</b> access within the repository -> Project <b>Reader</b> role
<br/>
<b>Push</b> access within the repository -> Project <b>Contributor</b> role
<br/>
<b>Admin</b> access within the repository -> Project <b>Maintainer</b> role
<br/>

### Organization role to project role mappings
Having specific roles within the organization can grant you a role within all of the projects automatically.

Organization <b>Owner</b> -> Project <b>Admin</b>
<br/>
Organization <b>Admin</b> -> Project <b>Admin</b>
<br/>

# Custom roles

If your organization has a need for more roles with permissions defined with higher granularity, you can define
custom roles that will be visible only within your organization. For each of those roles you can define permissions,
if the role is organizational you can define whether it will map to some project-level role, and if the role is
project scoped, you can also define if access to the project's repository will mean automatic assignment of the role.
