# Configuring Database Access

This document describes how you can create regular users and users with administrative privileges on databases supported by Semaphore 2.0.

## Postgres

### Creating a new Postgres user

In order to create a new user in Postgres, execute the
following command:

``` bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost -c "CREATE USER developer WITH PASSWORD 'developer';"
```

### Creating a new Postgres user with administrative privileges

In order to create a new user with administrative privileges in Postgres, execute the following command:

``` bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost -c "CREATE USER developer WITH PASSWORD 'developer';"
psql -U postgres -h localhost -c "ALTER USER developer WITH SUPERUSER;"
```

### Creating Postgres extensions

You can extend the capabilities of the default Postgres database by
creating extensions, as shown below:

```bash
psql -U postgres -h localhost -c "CREATE EXTENSION \"uuid-ossp\""
```

## MySQL

### Creating a new MySQL user

In order to create a new user in MySQL, execute the
following command:

``` bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -e "CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';"
```

### Creating a new MySQL user with administrative privileges

In order to create a new user with administrative privileges in MySQL, execute the following command:

``` bash
mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 -u root -e "CREATE USER 'newuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';"
```

## Redis

Redis database does not have the ability to define users.

## MongoDB

### Creating a new MongoDB user

In order to create a new user in MongoDB, execute the following
command:

``` bash
echo 'db.createUser( {user:"username", pwd:"password", roles:[], mechanisms:["SCRAM-SHA-1"]  } )' | mongo s2
```

### Creating a new MongoDB user with administrative privileges

In order to create a new user with administrative privileges in MongoDB, execute the following command:

``` bash
echo 'db.createUser({user:"username", pwd:"password", roles:[{role:"userAdminAnyDatabase",db:"admin"}], mechanisms:["SCRAM-SHA-1"]})' | mongo admin
```

## Memcached

Memcached database does not have users.

## Elasticsearch

### Creating a new Elasticsearch user

In order to create a new user in Elasticsearch, execute the
following command:

``` bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-users useradd new_user -p password -r reporting_user
```

### Creating a new Elasticsearch user with administrative privileges

In order to create a new user with administrative privileges in Elasticsearch, execute the following command:

``` bash
sudo /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-users useradd new_user -p password -r superuser
```

## A simple project

The following Semaphore 2.0 project illustrates all of the aforementioned commands in action:
