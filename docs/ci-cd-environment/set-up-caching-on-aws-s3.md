# Setting up caching with AWS S3

When running the Semaphore agent in a self-hosted environment, the cache storage available in hosted jobs will not be available. However, we can use an AWS S3 bucket to store our cache dependencies instead. In order to do so, the cache CLI needs access only to perform a few actions on an S3 bucket in your AWS account.

## Create AWS resources

The instructions that follow assume you already have the AWS CLI properly installed and configured in your personal machine. If youâ€™re not sure how to configure that, you can follow [this tutorial from AWS][set up aws cli]. You can also create the AWS resources described in this guide through the AWS console.

The bucket name we use in this example will be `semaphore-cache` and the AWS region will be `us-east-1`. Make sure you adjust the commands to match your bucket name and region of choice.

**1. Create your AWS S3 bucket and block public access to it:**

This is the bucket that the cache CLI will use to store and retrieve archives.

```
aws s3api create-bucket \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --bucket semaphore-cache

aws s3api put-public-access-block \
  --bucket semaphore-cache \
  --public-access-block-configuration \
BlockPublicAcls=true,IgnorePublicAcls=true,BlockPublicPolicy=true,RestrictPublicBuckets=true
```

**2. Create an AWS IAM policy**

It is always good practice to give services only the permissions they need. The cache CLI only needs access to perform the following AWS S3 actions:

- `s3:PutObject`
- `s3:GetObject`
- `s3:ListBucket`
- `s3:DeleteObject`

One way to grant access to only these actions is through an AWS IAM policy. You can create one with the following commands:

```
cat > /tmp/semaphore-cache-policy.json <<EOF
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "statement1",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::semaphore-cache/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::semaphore-cache"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
EOF

aws iam create-policy \
  --policy-name semaphore-cache-policy \
  --policy-document file:///tmp/semaphore-cache-policy.json \
  --description "Restricts access to some operations on the semaphore-cache S3 bucket"
```

The `aws iam create-policy` command will generate an output like this:

```json
{
  "Policy": {
    "PolicyName": "semaphore-cache-policy",
    "CreateDate": "2015-06-01T19:31:18.620Z",
    "AttachmentCount": 0,
    "IsAttachable": true,
    "PolicyId": "ZXR6A36LTYANPAI7NJ5UV",
    "DefaultVersionId": "v1",
    "Path": "/",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::0123456789012:policy/semaphore-cache-policy",
    "UpdateDate": "2015-06-01T19:31:18.620Z"
  }
}
```

Make sure you save the `Arn` of the AWS IAM policy. You'll use that value when attaching the AWS IAM policy to the AWS IAM user.

**3. Create the AWS IAM user and its access keys:**

This is the AWS IAM user the cache CLI will use to authorize and get access to your AWS bucket:

```
aws iam create-user --user-name semaphore
aws iam create-access-key --user-name semaphore
```

The `aws iam create-access-key` command will generate an output like this:

```json
{
  "AccessKey": {
    "UserName": "semaphore",
    "Status": "Active",
    "CreateDate": "...",
    "SecretAccessKey": "...",
    "AccessKeyId": "..."
  }
}
```

Make sure you save the `SecretAccessKey` and the `AccessKeyId` values. We will need them when configuring the `~/.aws` folder in the agent machine.

**4. Attach the AWS IAM policy to the AWS IAM user:**

Let's attach the AWS IAM policy we created on step #2 to the user we created on step #3:

```
aws iam attach-user-policy \
  --user-name semaphore \
  --policy-arn "[this is where the policy ARN you saved on step #2 needs to go]"
```

## Configure your machine

Once you have all the AWS resources created, let's jump into the machine running the agent and configure the AWS credentials for the cache CLI to use.

**1. Configure the `~/.aws` folder:**

Make sure you use the `SecretAccessKey` and `AccessKeyId` for the proper AWS IAM user. Also, make sure you replace `us-east-1` with your region of choice and `semaphore-cache` with your bucket name.

```
mkdir ~/.aws

cat > ~/.aws/config <<EOF
[default]
region = us-east-1
output = json
EOF

cat > ~/.aws/credentials <<EOF
[default]
aws_access_key_id = SecretAccessKey
aws_secret_access_key = AccessKeyId
EOF
```

Note that the `~/.aws` folder should be created in the home directory of the same user running the agent.

**2. Update the agent configuration:**

Finally, let's instruct the agent to pass the required environment variables to the cache CLI, by adding them in your agent's `config.yaml`:

```yaml
env-vars:
  - SEMAPHORE_CACHE_BACKEND=s3
  - SEMAPHORE_CACHE_S3_BUCKET=semaphore-cache
```

We're all set. After restarting your agent, you should be able to start using the cache CLI with your AWS S3 bucket in your pipelines.
