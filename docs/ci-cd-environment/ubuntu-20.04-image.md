# Ubuntu 20.04 Image


The `ubuntu2004` is a customized image based on [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FocalFossa/ReleaseNotes)
optimized for CI/CD. It comes with a set of preinstalled languages, databases,
and utility tools commonly used for CI/CD workflows. The image can be paired
with any [Linux machine type][machine-types] when defining the [agent][agent]
of your pipeline or block.

The `ubuntu2004` is a virtual machine (VM) image. The user in the environment,
named `semaphore`, has full `sudo` access. The image will be updated bi-weekly, on first and third Monday of every month.
Updates can be followed on [Semaphore Changelog](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/semaphore-changelog/).

The `ubuntu2004` VM uses an *APT mirror* that is in the same data center as
Semaphore's build cluster, which means that caching packages will have little
effect.

## Using the ubuntu2004 OS image in your agent configuration

To use the `ubuntu2004` OS image, define it as the `os_image` of your agent's
machine.

``` yaml
version: 1.0
name: Ubuntu18 Based Pipeline

agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004

blocks:
  - name: "Unit tests"
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: Tests
          commands:
            - make test
```

!!! warning "Available machine types"
    The `ubuntu2004` image will only work on `e1-standard-2` agents for now. 

    When switching the `os_image` to `ubuntu2004` make sure that the `e1-standard-2` machine type is selected.

## Toolbox

If the dependency you need is not present in the list above, you can install it
with the Ubuntu package manager
or using an alternative method such as compiling it from the source, or 
manually downloading binaries.

To install dependecies using the package manager (apt-get) you can use the
template command below and add it to your pipeline:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y [your-dependency]
```
