# Environment Variables

This document describes the environment variables used in Semaphore 2.0
projects.

Although some of the presented environment variables are defined on a per
project or on a per task basis, all the presented environment variables can be
seen on a per job basis.

## Predefined environment variables

Semaphore defines and uses its own environment variables.

### Semaphore related

This group of environment variables includes the environment variables that
are related to Semaphore 2.0 and hold information that is specific to Semaphore
2.0.

The value of the `CI` environment variable specifies whether we are in a
Continuous Integration environment or not. The type of the `CI` variable is
boolean.

Example value: `true`

executed in the Semaphore 2.0 environment or not and is a boolean variable.

Example value: `true`
