# Installing a self-hosted agent

!!! beta "Self-hosted agents - closed beta"
    Self-hosted agents are now in closed beta! If you would like to join beta and try this feature out, please [share your use case](https://semaphoreci.com/contact) with our team and we will add you to the waiting list and contact you after confirming that the feature suits your requirements. 

The Semaphore agent is open source and can be found [here][agent repo]. Before installing it in your machine, you need to make sure the following requirements are also available in it:

- bash
- git
- docker - [manageable without sudo][docker without sudo]
- docker-compose

Please, follow the installation instructions for your operating system of choice below.

## Installing the agent on Ubuntu/Debian

**1. Prepare your machine:**

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/semaphore/agent
sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/semaphore/agent/
cd /opt/semaphore/agent
```

**2. Download the agent:**

```
curl -L https://github.com/semaphoreci/agent/releases/download/v2.0.13/agent_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -o agent.tar.gz
tar -xf agent.tar.gz
```

**3. Install the agent:**

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

The script asks for your Semaphore organization name, the [agent type registration token][agent tokens] and the Linux user used to run the service and does the following:

- downloads and installs the [Semaphore toolbox][toolbox]
- creates a systemd service for the agent
- creates an initial `config.yaml` file in the installation directory for you to manage the [agent configuration][agent-configuration]

Note that any changes in the agent configuration file require a restart of the systemd service.

## Installing the agent on generic Linux

**1. Prepare your machine:**

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/semaphore/agent
sudo chown $USER:$USER /opt/semaphore/agent/
cd /opt/semaphore/agent
```

**2. Download the agent:**

```
curl -L https://github.com/semaphoreci/agent/releases/download/v2.0.13/agent_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz -o agent.tar.gz
tar -xf agent.tar.gz
```

**3. Create the agent configuration file:**

```
cat > config.yaml <<EOF
endpoint: "[your-organization-name].semaphoreci.com"
token: "[token]"
EOF
```

**4. Download and install the [toolbox][toolbox]:**

```
curl -L "https://github.com/semaphoreci/toolbox/releases/latest/download/self-hosted-linux.tar" -o toolbox.tar
tar -xf toolbox.tar
mv toolbox ~/.toolbox
bash ~/.toolbox/install-toolbox
source ~/.toolbox/toolbox
echo "source ~/.toolbox/toolbox" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

**5. Run the agent:**

```
agent start --config-file config.yaml
```

## Installing the agent on MacOS

**1. Install the agent using Homebrew:**

```

Note: If you don't want to use Homebrew, the agent can be downloaded directly from the [Releases page][releases-page].

**2. Download and install the [toolbox][toolbox]:**

```
curl -L "https://github.com/semaphoreci/toolbox/releases/latest/download/self-hosted-darwin.tar" -o toolbox.tar
tar -xf toolbox.tar
mv toolbox ~/.toolbox
bash ~/.toolbox/install-toolbox
source ~/.toolbox/toolbox
echo "source ~/.toolbox/toolbox" >> ~/.bash_profile
```
