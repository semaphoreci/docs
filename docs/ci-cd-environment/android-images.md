Description: This page lists the available Docker images that Semaphore provides for Android development.

Semaphore provides public [Docker images for Android development](/ci-cd-environment/semaphore-registry-images/#android) that can be used in the Semaphore environemnt.

Android images come in three forms:

- Android:[sdk version]
- Android:[sdk version]-node
- Android:[sdk version]-flutter

where `sdk-version` can be 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34.

For images using the stable sdk versions (33 for now), we provide cached access.<br/>
The images are updated on a biweekly basis.

For an example using the Flutter image, please consult our [Flutter example](flutter.md)
