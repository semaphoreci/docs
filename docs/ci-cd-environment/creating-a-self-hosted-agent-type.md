1. Go to `<your-organization-name>.semaphoreci.com/self_hosted_agents`
2. Click the `Add a self hosted agent type` button
3. Give it a name and click `Looks good. Register`
4. Your agent type should be created. Follow the instructions to install the agent in your operating system of choice. The instructions are also available [here][installing-agents].
