# Add-ons

You can further enhance your CI/CD experience with the purchase of add-ons.

The following add-ons are available to all customers on [Startup](/account-management/startup-plan) and [Scaleup](/account-management/scaleup-plan) plans:

- [Dedicated cache server](#dedicated-cache-server)
- [Dedicated container registry](#dedicated-container-registry)
- [Advanced support package](#advanced-and-premium-support-packages)
- [Premium support package](#advanced-and-premium-support-packages)

## How to enable add-ons

If you're interested in trying out or enabling any of the available add-ons please reach out to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Add-on pricing

All add-ons have a flat price per month. At the start of each billing period, the cost of any add-on enabled for your organization will be added to your monthly bill.

## Dedicated cache server

The Semaphore [Cache](/essentials/caching-dependencies-and-directories/) tool optimizes CI/CD runtime by reusing files that your project depends on but are not part of version control. Each organization has access to the shared cache, which has a maximum total cache size of **9.6 GB**.

If you need to improve cache performance, you can add the **Dedicated Cache Server** add-on. This cache server is located in the same infrastructure as your Semaphore cloud jobs and provides **400 GB** of disk space and a **10 Gb/s** network connection.

The dedicated cache server add-on costs **$400,00** per month.

## Dedicated container registry

To speed up Docker-based builds, you can store your Docker images in a **dedicated container registry** with fast network access.

This registry is located in the same infrastructure as your cloud jobs, minimizing upload and download times. It comes with **400 GB** disk space and a **10 Gb/s** network connection.

Dedicated container registry costs **$400,00** per month.

## Advanced and Premium support packages

All paid plans come with a basic account and technical support. However, you can upgrade your support package to receive additional benefits, such as:

- **Support SLAs** (24x5 or 24x7 options)
- **Slack Channel** for aligning with our team on time-sensitive issues or requests
