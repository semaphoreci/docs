# Billing FAQ

## Can I try out Semaphore without giving my credit card info?

You can try out Semaphore by creating a new **trial** organization. The trial period lasts for 14 days. During the trial period, you can use all features available on the [Startup plan](/account-management/startup-plan/).

Once you add the credit card, your organization will be on a Startup plan.

After your trial expires your pipelines will be blocked until you add your credit card info.

If you need more time for testing out the service or you want to upgrade to the Scaleup plan once the trial ends, please reach out to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## How can I track my spending?

## How can I change VAT number?

After a subscription has been purchased, it is not possible for users to add or change

## Will I get an invoice?

You will receive an invoice for your organization at the end of each billing
period. This invoice will be sent to the email address that was entered when payment info was added.

You can also find your invoices at the bottom of the Plans & Billing page within the app.

## What is your refund policy?

Apart from cases of extended downtime (multiple hours in a day, or multiple days
in a month), we do not offer refunds. We will, however, consider requests for refunds in
extenuating circumstances. If you would like to request a refund, please email us at
