# Free and open source plans

## Free plan

Semaphore offers a free tier plan with no subscription or seat costs.

Each user can register one free plan organization.

At the start of each billing cycle, organizations on the free plan receive **$10** worth of credits to be used for machine time or storage and egress.

These credits equate to *1,300 minutes* of *e1-standard-2* machine time.

Please note that these free credits are non-transferable and will be reset at the beginning of each billing cycle.

Concurrency is **limited to one job** for organizations on the free plan.

The following machine types are available on this plan:

- **Linux**: *e1-standard-2*
- **MacOS**: *a1-standard-4*
- **Self-hosted**: *1 agent*

If you want to upgrade from the free plan, you can do so at any time on your billing page within the app by choosing the Startup plan.

## Open Source plan

The Open Source plan offers unlimited build minutes for building public repositories **at no cost**.

Please note that each user can only have one organization on this plan at any given time.

Organizations on the Open Source plan can only create projects with *public* visibility.

Concurrency is limited for organizations on the Open Source plan as follows:

- **Linux**: *e1-standard-2* - maximum of 4 jobs running in parallel.
- **MacOS**: *a1-standard-4* - maximum of 1 job running in parallel.
- **Self-hosted**: *maximum of 4 agents*

Please keep in mind that open source projects can be built for free only on the Open Source plan. If you are building open source projects on a paid plan, you will be charged according to that plan's pricing.
