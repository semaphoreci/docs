# Legacy plans

The following paid plans are no longer supported and are no longer available for new sign-ups:

- Standard plan
- Enterprise Cloud plan

We recommend that all existing users on these plans to upgrade to one of the updated plans:

- [Startup plan](/account-management/startup-plan/)
- [Scaleup plan](/account-management/scaleup-plan/)

## Enterprise Cloud plan

The Enterprise Cloud plan has been renamed to the [Scaleup plan](/account-management/scaleup-plan/). There are no significant differences between the two plans other than the name change. All existing Enterprise Cloud customers will be automatically transitioned to the Scaleup plan. The previously agreed upon seat prices, machine quotas, and other parameters will not change.

## Standard plan

This plan has been discontinued and is no longer available for new sign-ups. Organizations currently on the Standard plan have two options:

- Remain on the Standard plan indefinetely
- Upgrade to the [Startup plan](/account-management/startup-plan/)

Please note that any **new features or functionality** will only be available on the updated plans. Organizations on the Standard plan will continue to have access to all of the features they had at the time of sign-up.
