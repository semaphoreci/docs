# Billing

Billing page is accessible to the creator of the organization and admins and you
can find it in the Owner’s area of your organization.

Here you can find all the details related to your usage:

1. [Machine types](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/20-machine-types)
2. [Prices](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing) of each machine in dollars per
second
3. Number of seconds each machine was used
4. Spendings (per machine and total)

**Note:** To see the fully updated usage, you should allow for up to
24h to pass.

## Billing insights

The organization owner and admins can see usage in more details by clicking on
**See detailed insights…** in the top right corner of the Billing page. Here
you can find:

- Daily spending chart which contains spending per machine type. This data is
available for any selected period.
- Quota chart which contains the maximal number of machines running at the same
time. This data is available for the current and previous months.
- Top spending projects.

## Budget alert

Organization owner and admins can set up budget alerts. An email notification
will be sent, to the organization's owner email address, when you spend 50%, 90%
and 100% of your budget within one month's spending. However, pipelines won't be
disabled once you go past the budget.

You can set a budget alert through the Semaphore 2.0 UI (Billing > Set budget…)
when the organization is on a paid plan.
