# Plans

With Semaphore 2.0 you will only pay for what you used and you can customize
your usage according to your team's needs.

## Trial Period

The trial period lasts for 14 days. During the trial period, you can use
[the default machine quota](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/quotas-and-limits/)
completely free of charge.

Of course, you can easily scale up if you need a bigger capacity by going to
**Billing > See detailed insights… > Quota > Request upgrade…** or by reaching
out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)
(please include which type of machine you prefer).

**Note:** If you currently have an annual subscription on Semaphore Classic and
would like to migrate to 2.0, please reach out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Paid plan

The Paid plan is activated once you add your credit card. You will be
charged based on your usage at the beginning of each month for the previous
month. Billing cycles are based on calendar months.

You can find the default number of machines for Paid plans on the [Quotas and
Limits page](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/quotas-and-limits/).
If you need to scale up, you can easily do that by going to
**Billing > See detailed insights… > Quota > Request upgrade…** or by reaching
out to
[customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com)
(please include which type of machine you prefer).

In Semaphore 2.0, all organizations are on monthly plans.

**Note:** If you are building open source projects on a Paid plan, you will be 
charged according to our [pricing page](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing) for these
builds, too. Open source projects can be built free of charge only on an [Open Source
plan](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/account-management/plans/#open-source-plan).

## Open Source plan

On this plan, you have unlimited build minutes for building your public
repositories. You also have four e1-standard-2 machines and one a1-standard-4 
machine at your disposal.

Only one of the organizations you own can be on an open source plan.

**Note:** Open source projects can be built free of charge only on an Open Source
plan. If you are building open source projects on a [Paid plan](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/account-management/plans/#paid-plan), you will be charged according to our [pricing page](https://semaphoreci.com/pricing)
for these builds.

## Free plan

The Free plan includes $10 (up to 1300 build minutes) of free credit per calendar 
month. At the beginning of each month, you will receive a new $10 credit for your
organization. On this plan, you will be able to run 1 job at a time and you can 
use e1-standard-2 machine and a1-standard-4 machine.

You can have an unlimited number of organizations, but only one of the
organizations you own can be on a free plan.

## Grandfathered plans for Semaphore Classic users

If your organization is on a paid plan on Semaphore Classic, you are eligible for 
a Grandfathered plan on Semaphore 2.0. On this plan, we match your Semaphore Classic 
costs and capacity so you can use Semaphore 2.0 at the same monthly price. 

If you are interested in this plan, please reach out to [customersuccess@semaphoreci.com](mailto:customersuccess@semaphoreci.com).

## Upgrading to a paid plan

To upgrade to a paid plan, go to the Billing page and click on
**Upgrade to remove the limit** button in the top right corner. After that,
enter your credit card information and that’s it.
