# Secrets

This page shows you how to store and access sensitive data such as API keys,
passwords, certificates, SSH keys, etc. Semaphore uses "secrets" to accomplish this.

## Overview

Secrets are organization-level objects that contain environment
variables and files. The contents of secrets can be accessed in jobs that are part of
blocks or pipelines to which they have been connected.

## Using secrets in jobs

### Web UI

1. Open the project page

2. Click the **Edit Workflow** button

3. Select the block to which you want to connect the secret

4. Find the **Secrets** section in the right sidebar

5. Select the secret that you want to be connected

6. Click the **Run the workflow** button and then **Start**

### YAML

To connect a secret to a particular block add the [secrets property](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/pipeline-yaml-reference/#secrets), as shown below:

```yaml
version: v1.0
name: My blue project
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Test
    task:
      # Connect secret to all jobs in the block
      secrets:
        - name: blue-secret

      jobs:
      - name: Run tests
        commands:
          - checkout
          - make test
```

To connect a secret to all jobs in a pipeline use
[global_job_config](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/pipeline-yaml-reference/#global_job_config), as shown below:

```yaml
version: v1.0
name: My blue project
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

global_job_config:
  # Connect secret to all jobs in the pipeline
  secrets:
    - name: blue-secret

blocks:
  ...
```

## Creating and managing secrets

When creating secrets, it is recommended to grant access to the minimum subset of projects necessary. 
Access policies can be used to control which projects have access to the organization's secrets. 
Organization-level secrets enable sharing secrets between multiple projects, reducing duplication. 
Updating an organization secret in one location ensures that the change is reflected in all projects using it.

By default, all projects have access to secrets, but access can be restricted to a specific subset of projects using a project whitelist. To do this, choose **Whitelisted** and enter the project names.

Organization-level secrets can also have restrictions in terms of availability in interactive sessions such as debug jobs and attaching to jobs that have the secret injected. These restrictions can be set up to prevent debugging or attaching to the project.


### Web UI

1. Open the dashboard of your organization

2. Click **Secrets** in the sidebar -- you can find it in the **Configuration** section

3. Click the **Create New Secret** button

4. Enter your secret information:
   * Specify **Name**
   * Enter the environment variable's name and value
   * Enter the destination file path and upload the file

5. Click **Save Changes**

### CLI

The [sem create
secret](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/sem-command-line-tool/#sem-create)
command, shown below:

```
sem create secret blue-secret -e AWS_KEY=a1b2 -e AWS_SECRET=r2d2
```

Can be used to create a secret that also contains a file, as shown below:

```
sem create secret red-secrets -e AWS_KEY=a1b2 -f /Users/john/key.pem:/home/semaphore/key.pem
```

To view a secret use:

```
sem get secret blue-secret
```

To edit a secret use:

```
sem edit secret blue-secret
```
