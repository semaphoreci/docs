# Secrets

This page shows you how to store and access sensitive data such as API keys,
passwords, certificates, SSH keys, etc. Semaphore uses "secrets" to accomplish this.

## Overview

Secrets are organization-level objects that contain environment
variables and files. The contents of secrets can be accessed in jobs that are part of
blocks or pipelines to which they have been connected.

## Using secrets in jobs

### Web UI

1. Open the project page

2. Click the **Edit Workflow** button

3. Select the block to which you want to connect the secret

4. Find the **Secrets** section in the right sidebar

5. Select the secret that you want to be connected

6. Click the **Run the workflow** button and then **Start**

### YAML

To connect a secret to a particular block add the [secrets property](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/pipeline-yaml-reference/#secrets), as shown below:

```yaml
version: v1.0
name: My blue project
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

blocks:
  - name: Test
    task:
      # Connect secret to all jobs in the block
      secrets:
        - name: blue-secret

      jobs:
      - name: Run tests
        commands:
          - checkout
          - make test
```

To connect a secret to all jobs in a pipeline use
[global_job_config](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/pipeline-yaml-reference/#global_job_config), as shown below:

```yaml
version: v1.0
name: My blue project
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu1804

global_job_config:
  # Connect secret to all jobs in the pipeline
  secrets:
    - name: blue-secret

blocks:
  ...
```

## Creating and managing secrets

When creating secrets, we recommend that you grant it to minimum subset of projects possible. For this purpouse 
you can use access policies to control which projects can use organization secrets. 
Organization-level secrets let you share secrets between multiple projects, 
which reduces the need for creating duplicate secrets. Updating an organization secret in 
one location also ensures that the change takes effect in all projects that use that secret.
By default all the projects have access to a secret, it is possible to restrict a secret to only a subset of projects using
project whitelist available when creating a new secret, or editing an existing one. You choose **Whitelisted** and type project names.

### Web UI

1. Open the dashboard of your organization

2. Click **Secrets** in the sidebar -- you can find it in the **Configuration** section

3. Click the **Create New Secret** button

4. Enter your secret information:
   * Specify **Name**
   * Enter the environment variable's name and value
   * Enter the destination file path and upload the file

5. Click **Save Changes**

### CLI

The [sem create
secret](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/sem-command-line-tool/#sem-create)
command, shown below:

```
sem create secret blue-secret -e AWS_KEY=a1b2 -e AWS_SECRET=r2d2
```

Can be used to create a secret that also contains a file, as shown below:

```
sem create secret red-secrets -e AWS_KEY=a1b2 -f /Users/john/key.pem:/home/semaphore/key.pem
```

To view a secret use:

```
sem get secret blue-secret
```

To edit a secret use:

```
sem edit secret blue-secret
```

For more information about managing secrets check the [sem CLI Reference](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/reference/sem-command-line-tool/).
