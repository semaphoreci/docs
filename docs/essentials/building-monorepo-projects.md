# Monorepo Workflows

A [monorepo](https://semaphoreci.com/blog/what-is-monorepo)
(short for monolithic repository) is a software development strategy
where code for many applications that may or may not be mutually dependent is
stored in the same version-controlled repository.

This guide shows you how to optimize your Semaphore workflow for monorepo
projects.

Some advantages of a monorepo approach are:

- Ease of code reuse - it is easy to abstract shared behavior into common libraries.
- Simplified dependency management - third-party dependencies are easily shared.
- Atomic commits across multiple applications - you can refactor multiple applications at once with a single commit.
- Single source of truth - thereâ€™s only one version of each dependency.
- Unified CI/CD - a standardized CI process can build and deploy every application in the repository.

Semaphore comes with out-of-box support for monorepos and provides
a [example project][monorepo-example] for you to try.

## Setting up a monorepo project

Let's say you have a simple monorepo project that consists of:

- A web application located inside `/web-app/` directory.
- An iOS client application located inside `/ios/` directory.
- A separate docs web page located inside `/docs/` directory.

We can setup a Semaphore pipeline that builds and test each one of these applications.

![Monorepo
Pipeline](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/pipeline.png)

With this setup, we run separate tests for each part of the system and
integration tests once both web application and iOS client tests pass.

## Change-based block execution

You can set the criteria for running the jobs within a block in the
*Skip/Run conditions* section. The [run property][run-ref] is evaluated on
each workflow to decide is the block should run or be skipped.

![Skip/Run
conditions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/skip-run-condition.png)

When combined with `change_in` function, which checks whether there were
any changes on given paths, allows us to only run tests for those parts of
the project that are currently being
worked on.

In the example below, this means that if we are working only on the iOS
client app within the `/ios/` directory of the repository, the only blocks
that will be executed are the `Test iOS client` and `Integration tests`.
Everything else will be skipped.

![change_in examples](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/skip-run-blocks.png)

This can significantly reduce the time and cost while still providing you
with required feedback for the changes introduced into the monorepo.

The `change_in` function calculates the changeset (all changed files in
the commit range of interest for given workflow) in a slightly different
way for the `master/main` and the other branches or pull requests. For
more details and ways in which this can be modified please check the
[reference][change-in-ref].

## Set up the automatic deployments for a monorepo project

Here we will assume that you already have three pipelines for:

- Deploying the web app
- Releasing the iOS client
- Publishing the documentation pages

You can find examples for various kinds of deployments in the [use
cases][use-cases] section of our docs. We will focus on auto-promoting the
right pipelines using change detection. To achieve this, we need to
introduce the [promotions][promotions-ref] conditions.

![Adding a promotion](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/add-promotion.png)

Ticking **Enable automatic promotion** brings up the a conditions field.
Semaphore supports using `change_in` in this field. You can combine it
with the `branch` and `result` properties to start a pipeline on a given
branch. For example, for the web app:

![Promotion for Web
app](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/promotion-web.png)

To complete the example, this is how the `iOS Release` and `Publish
docs` pipelines should look:

![Promotion for iOS
Client](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/promotion-ios.png)

![Promotion for docs
pages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/semaphoreci/docs/tf/monorepo-example/public/essentials-monorepo-workflows/promotion-docs.png)

Each part of the system will be automatically deployed when the tests pass
on the master branch only if the push that initiated workflow contains
changes in the location(s) given to the `change_in` function.

## Additional examples of monorepo configuration

### When a directory changes

```yaml
change_in('/web-app/')
```

### When a file changes

```yaml
change_in('../Gemfile.lock')
```

### Changing the default branch from master to main

```yaml
change_in('/web-app/', {default_branch: 'main'})
```

### Exclude changes in the pipeline file

**Note:** If you change the pipeline file, Semaphore will consider `change_in` as true.
The following illustrates how to disable this behaviour.

```yaml
change_in('/web-app/', {pipeline_file: 'ignore'})
```
