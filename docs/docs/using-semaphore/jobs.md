# Jobs

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import VideoTutorial from '@site/src/components/VideoTutorial';

Jobs get stuff done. This page explains how jobs and blocks work, how you can configure them, and what settings are available.

## Job lifecycle {#job-lifecycle}

Jobs run arbitrary shell commands inside a dedicated environment called an [agent](./pipelines#agents). Agents are ephemeral Docker containers, Kubernetes pods, or x86/ARM VMs running Linux, macOS, or [Windows] (TODO: link to self-hosted)

When a job is scheduled, the following happens:

1. **Allocate agent**: pick a suitable agent from the warm pool of agents
2. **Initialize**: execute setup steps such as importing environment variables, loading SSH keys, mounting [secrets](#secrets), and installing the [Semaphore toolbox](#toolbox)
3. **Run commands**: execute your commands
4. **End job and save logs**: the job activity log is saved for future inspection
5. **Destroy agent**: the used agent is *discarded*, along with all its contents

![Job Lifecycle](./img/job-lifecycle.jpg)

:::note

Agents can be non-ephemeral when using [self-hosted agents].

:::

## How to create a job {#job-create}

You can create a job with the visual editor or by creating a YAML file.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor" default>

Open your [project](./projects) on Semaphore and press **Edit Workflow**.

![Screenshot of the project opened in Semaphore. The Edit Workflow button is highlighted](./img/edit-workflow.jpg)

1. Select the first block
2. Type your shell commands
3. Press **Run the workflow**, then press **Looks good, Start →**

![New job being edited](./img/create-a-job-1.jpg)
 
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Create a file called `.semaphore/semaphore.yml` at the repository's root
2. Add the pipeline `name`
3. Define an [agent](./pipelines#agents)
4. Create a `blocks` key and type the block's `name`
5. Add a `task.jobs` key. The value is a list of jobs
6. Type the job's `name`
7. Add the job's `commands`. The value is a list of shell commands (one line per list item)
8. Save the file, commit and push it to your remote repository

You can use the following code as a starting point:

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - echo "hello, world!"'
            - echo "add as many commands as you like"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Semaphore automatically starts the job when the file is saved. Click the running job to follow the progress and view its log.

![Job log](./img/job-log.jpg)

:::info

A *block* is a group of jobs that [share common settings](#block-settings).

:::

### Run jobs in parallel {#jobs-parallel}

Jobs added to the same block not only [share settings](#block-settings), but also *run in parallel*.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

To run two jobs in parallel:

1. Select the block
2. Press **+ Add job**
3. Type the job name and commands

![Adding a second job](./img/jobs-parallel.jpg)

Here you can also:
- Delete a job by pressing the X sign next to it. 
- Delete the whole block along with the jobs by scrolling down and clicking on **Delete block...**

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Add a new `name` item under `jobs`
2. Add your shell commands (one per line) under `commands`
3. Save the file, commit and push it to your repository

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yaml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - echo "this is job 1"
        # highlight-start
        - name: 'Job #2'
          commands:
            - echo "this is job 2"
        # highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info

You can't share files between jobs living in the same block. This is because each job is allocated to a separate [agent](./pipelines#agents).

:::

### Run jobs in sequence {#jobs-sequence}

If you want to run jobs one after the other, i.e. not in parallel, you must define them in separate blocks.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Click on **+Add Block**
2. Type the name of the block
3. Adjust dependencies to define execution order
4. Type the name and commands for the job

![Adding a second job and using dependencies to define execution order](./img/add-block.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Add a new job entry under `blocks`
2. Add a `dependencies`. List the names of the dependent blocks.
 
```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: 'Block #1'
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - echo "this is job 1 of block 1"
  # highlight-start
  - name: 'Block #2'
    dependencies:
      - 'Block #1'
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: 'Job #1'
          commands:
            - echo "this is job 1 of block 2"
  # highlight-end
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip

All files are lost when the job ends. This happens because each jobs are allocated to different agents. If you want to share files between jobs, use the [checkout](#checkout) and [artifact](#artifact) commands.

:::

### Connecting blocks

A group of connected blocks constitutes a *pipeline*. We use dependencies to control the order in which blocks run. Dependencies are explained in detail in the [pipelines page](./pipelines#dependencies).

## Semaphore toolbox {#toolbox}

The [Semaphore toolbox] is a set of command line tools to carry essential tasks in your jobs such as cloning the repository or moving data between jobs.

The most-used tools in the Semaphore toolbox are: 

- [checkout](#checkout) clones the remote Git repository
- [cache](#cache) speeds up jobs by caching downloaded files
- [artifact](#artifact) saves and moves files between jobs

### checkout {#checkout}

The [checkout] command clones the remote Git repository and `cd`s into the repository directory so you're ready to work.

The following example shows the first commands for working with a Node.js project. We run `checkout` to get a local copy of the code. Next, we can run `npm install` because we can assume that `package.json` and `package-lock.json` exist in the current directory.

```shell
# highlight-next-line
checkout
npm install
```

Here is how the same code looks in a Semaphore job.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

![Running checkout with the visual editor](./img/checkout.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:
  - name: Install
    dependencies: []
    task:
      jobs:
        - name: npm install
          commands:
            # highlight-next-line
            - checkout
            - npm install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
 <summary>How does checkout work?</summary>
 <div>
 During agent initialization, Semaphore sets four [environment variables](#environment-variables) that define how checkout works:
 - SEMAPHORE_GIT_URL: the URL of the repository (e.g. git@github.com:mycompany/myproject.git).
 - SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR: the path where the repository is to be cloned (e.g. `/home/semaphore/myproject`)
 - SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA: the SHA key for the HEAD used for `git reset -q --hard`
 - SEMAPHORE_GIT_DEPTH: checkout does by default a shallow clone. This is the depth level for the shallow clone. Defaults to 50
 </div>
</details>

### cache {#cache}

:::note

Using `cache` in [self-hosted agents] requires additional setup steps.

:::

The main function of the [cache] is to speed up job execution by caching downloaded files.

The `cache store` and `cache restore` commands can detect well-known files and folders. Let's say we want to speed up `npm install`, here is how to do it:

```shell
checkout
# highlight-next-line
cache restore
npm install
# highlight-next-line
cache store
```

The highlighted lines show how to use the cache:

- **cache store**: saves `node_modules` to non-ephemeral storage. It knows it's a Node project because it found `package.json` in the working folder.
- **cache restore**: retrieves the cached copy of `node_modules` to the working directory.

Cache is not limited to Node.js. It works with [several languages and frameworks]. Alternatively, you can use cache with any kind of file or folder but in that case, you need to [supply additional arguments].


### artifact {#artifact}

:::note

Using `artifact` in [self-hosted agents] requires additional setup steps.

:::

The [artifact] command can be used:

- as a way to move files between jobs and runs
- as persistent storage for artifacts like compiled binaries or bundles

The following example shows how to persist files between jobs. In the first job we have:

```shell
checkout
npm run build
# highlight-next-line
artifact push workflow dist
```

In the following jobs, we can access the content of the dist folder with:

```shell
artifact pull workflow dist
```

Let's do another example: this time we want to save the compiled binary `hello.exe`:

```shell
checkout
go build 
# highlight-next-line
artifact push project hello.exe
```

Artifacts can be viewed and downloaded from the Semaphore [project](./projects).

![Artifact view in Semaphore](./img/artifact-view.jpg)

<details>
 <summary>Artifact namespaces</summary>
 <div>
    Semaphore uses three separate namespaces of artifacts: job, workflow, and project. The syntax is:

    ```shell
    artifact pull|push job|workflow|project /path/to/file/or/folder
    ```

    The namespace used controls at what level the artifact is accessible:

    - **job** artifacts are only accessible to the job that created it. Useful for collecting debugging data
    - **workflow** artifacts are accessible to all jobs in all running [pipelines](./pipelines). The main use case is to pass data between jobs.
    - **project** artifacts are always accessible. They are ideal for storing final deliverables. 

 </div>
</details>


## Debugging jobs {#debug-jobs}

Semaphore makes it easy to troubleshoot jobs. You can debug a job [interactively with an SSH session](#ssh-into-agent) or see the job output in real-time.

### Why my job has failed? {#debug-job}

Semaphore ends the job as soon as a command ends with non-zero exit status. Once a job has failed, no new jobs will be started and the workflow is marked as failed.

Open the job log to see why it failed. The problematic command is shown in red. You can click on the commands to expand their output.

![Job log with the error shown](./img/failed-job-log.jpg)

:::tip

If you want to ignore the exit status of a command append `|| true` at the end. For example:

```shell
echo "the next command might fail, that's OK, I don't care"
# highlight-next-line
command_that_might_fail || true
echo "continuing job..."
```

:::

### Interactive debug with SSH {#ssh-into-agent}

You can debug a job interactively by SSHing into the agent. This is a very  powerful feature for troubleshooting.

![An interactive SSH session](./img/ssh-debug-session.png)

:::note

If this is the first time using an interactive session you need to [install and connect] the Semaphore command line tool.

:::

To open an interactive session, open the job log and:

1. Click on **SSH Debug**
2. Copy the command shown
3. Run the command in a terminal

![How to connect with SSH for the first time](./img/sem-debug.jpg)

You'll be presented with a welcome message like this:

```shell
* Creating debug session for job 'd5972748-12d9-216f-a010-242683a04b27'
* Setting duration to 60 minutes
* Waiting for the debug session to boot up ...
* Waiting for ssh daemon to become ready.

Semaphore CI Debug Session.

 - Checkout your code with `checkout`
 - Run your CI commands with `source ~/commands.sh`
 - Leave the session with `exit`

Documentation: https://docs.semaphoreci.com/essentials/debugging-with-ssh-access/.

semaphore@semaphore-vm:~$
```

To run the actual job commands in the SSH session:

```shell
source ~/commands.sh
```

You can actually run anything in the agent, including commands that were not actually part of the job. Exit the session to end the job. 

By default, the duration of the SSH session is limited to one hour. To run longer debug sessions, pass the duration flag to the previous command as shown below:

```shell
sem debug job <job-id> --duration 3h
```

:::note

Interactive sessions may be unavailable when [access policies for secrets](./organizations#secret-access-policy) is enabled.

:::

### Inspecting running jobs {#attach-job}

You attach a terminal console to a running job. The steps are the same as [debugging a job](#ssh-into-agent). The only difference is that Semaphore presents the following command (only while the job is running):

```shell
sem attach <job-id>
```
You can explore running processes, inspect the environment variables, and take a peek at the log files to help identify problems with your jobs.

:::note

Inspecting running jobs may be unavailable when [access policies for secrets](./organizations#secret-access-policy) is enabled.

:::

### Port forwarding {#port-forwarding}

When SSH is not enough to troubleshoot an issue, you can forward use port forwarding to connect to services listening to ports in the agent.

A typical use case for this feature is troubleshooting end-to-end tests. Let's say a test is failing and you can't find any obvious cause from the logs alone. Port forwarding the HTTP port in the agent to your local machine can reveal how the application "looks".

To start a port-forwarding session:

```shell
sem port-forward <job-id> <local-port> <remote-port>
```

For example, to forward an application listening on port 3000 in the agent to your machine on port 6000:

```shell
sem port-forward <job-id> 6000 3000
```

You can now connect to `http://localhost:6000` to view the application running remotely in the agent.

:::note

Port-forwarding only works for Virtual Machine-based agents. It's not available in [Docker environments](./pipelines#docker-environments).

:::

## Block settings {#block-settings}

Block settings apply to every job in the block.

### Prologue {#prologue}

Commands in the *prologue* run before each job in the block. Use this to run common setup commands like downloading dependencies, setting the runtime version, or starting test services.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the block
2. Open the prologue section and add your shell commands. 

In the example below we use [checkout](#checkout) to clone the repository at the start of every job in the block.

![Adding commands to the prologue](./img/prologue.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Locate the block you wish to add the prologue to
2. Add the `prologue` under `tasks`
3. The `commands` are prepended to all jobs in the block. 

In the example below we use [checkout](#checkout) to clone the repository at the start of every job in the block.

```yaml title=".semaphore/semaphore.yml"
version: v1.0
name: Initial Pipeline
agent:
  machine:
    type: e1-standard-2
    os_image: ubuntu2004
blocks:

      prologue:
        commands:
          - checkout
      # highlight-end
      jobs:
        - name: Build
          commands:
            - make build
        - name: Lint
          commands:
            - make lint
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Epilogue {#epilogue}

Commands in the *epilogue* are executed after each job in the job ends. There are three epilogue types:

- **Execute always**: always runs after the job ends, even if the job failed
- **If job has passed**: commands to run when the job passes (all commands exited with zero status)
- **If job has failed**: commands to run when the job failed (one command exited with non-zero status)

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the block
2. Open the epilogue section (you may need to scroll down) and add your commands

In the example below we use [artifact](#artifact) to save build artifacts and log files.

          commands:
            - 'echo "job passed, saving build artifact"'
            - artifact push project a.out
        on_fail:
          commands:
            - 'echo "job failed, saving build log"'
            - artifact push job build.log

### Environment variables {#environment-variables}

Environment variables are exported into the shell environment of every job in the block. You must supply the variable name and value.

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

To add an environment variable:
1. Select the block
2. Open the **Environment Variables** section (you may need to scroll down)

```

:::info

Numeric values need to be included in quotes.

:::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
 <summary>Environment variables or shell exports?</summary>
 <div>

    You can define environment variables in two ways:

    - by putting them in the [environment variables](#environment-variables) section
    - by using `export` commands in the job window: `export NODE_ENV="production"`

 </div>
</details>

### Secrets {#secrets}

<VideoTutorial title="How to use secrets" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rAJIRX81DeA"/>

Secrets store sensitive data such as API keys, passwords, or SSH keys. Secrets are enabled at the block level and available to all the jobs in the block.

You must create the secret before you can add it to a block. How you create the secret depends on its scope:

- [Organization secrets](./organizations#secrets) are available globally
- [Project secrets](./projects#secrets) are available only to the pipelines belonging to a [project](./projects)
- [Environment credentials](./promotions#credentials) are fine-grained secrets only available to specific [pipelines](./pipelines)

Once you create a secret you can no longer view its contents. Secrets are automatically decrypted at runtime when the job starts. Their values are available as environment variables or mounted as files.

To enable secrets in a block:

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the block 
2. Open the **Secrets** section (you may need to scroll down)
3. Enable the checkbox next to the secret

The secret values are now available for all jobs in the block.

![Importing secrets](./img/secrets.jpg)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yaml" label="YAML">

1. Locate the block where you want to add the secrets
2. Add a `secrets` key under `tasks`
3. List the names of the secrets to import

            - aws s3 ls
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Skip/run conditions {#skip-run}

You can choose to skip or run the block only under certain conditions. Skipping a block means that none of its job are executed.

Use cases for this feature include skipping a block on certain branches, or working with [monorepo projects].

<Tabs groupId="editor-yaml">
<TabItem value="editor" label="Editor">

1. Select the block
2. Open the **Skip/Run conditions** section (you may need to scroll down)
