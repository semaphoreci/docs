Organization Health provides an overview of all your project metrics in one place. For example,
you can see the worse-performing projects for the last 30 days, which can help you spot potential problems and
find optimization opportunities across your organization.

### Where can you find Organization Health

If your organization is on the Scaleup plan, a new tab will appear on your Semaphore Dashboard
on the right of "My Starred Projects".

### Metrics available and functionality

Organization Health lists your projects and their Performance, Reliability, and Frequency characteristics.
You'll also get when your team Last run a project, which helps identify stale projects.

!!! warning "Note: We calculate these metrics every few hours, Last Run may not be up-to date."

By default, the system sorts your organization's list of projects by worst performance, but you can change that by
clicking the arrows or the metric name you want to sort by. Sorting by ascending or descending order is available in all cases.
