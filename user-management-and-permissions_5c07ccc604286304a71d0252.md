Semaphore organizations can have unlimited members. Members have different
permissions based on their role.

## Owner

The creator of organization is its owner. There cannot be multiple owners, but
it is possible to [transfer the ownership](https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/106-user-management-and-permissions#transferring-ownership-of-an-organization).

### Owner project permissions

Owner can:

- See all projects;
- Add projects, if they have admin access to the repository on GitHub;
- Delete projects if they have admin access to the repository on Github;
- Manage people;
- Manage billing;

### Owner's area access

Owner also has access to the Owner's area, which includes:

#### Owner people management permissions

Owners can:

- **Add new members to organization**. Members can be invited by their GitHub
  username. New members will be able to enter the organization the first time
  they sign in with their GitHub accounts. _Note_: If you want someone to have
  access to a project on Semaphore, you first need to give this person access
  to the repository on GitHub, and then add them as a member to Semaphore on
  `ORG.semaphoreci.com/people` page.

- **Remove members from organization**. Upon removal, their access to all
  projects in the organization will be revoked. Please note that this won't
  change their permissions on GitHub.

- **Promote members to admins**.

#### Owner billing management permissions

Owner can see the billing section and perform changes, such as enter credit
card information, and see the current spending.
