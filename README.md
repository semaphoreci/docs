## Usage

### Creating new file

- create a file in HelpScout docs
  - HelpScout will assign a URL to it which we'll use for next step (`https://docs.semaphoreci.com/article/33-example?preview=5b4699632c7d3a099f2e742a`)
- create file in repository `5b4699632c7d3a099f2e742a_example.md`
  - `5b4699632c7d3a099f2e742a` is `id` of specific article
  - `example` is article's `slug`
