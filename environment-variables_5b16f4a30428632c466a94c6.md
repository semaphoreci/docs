## Overview

This document describes the environment variables used in Semaphore 2.0
projects.

Although some of the presented environment variables are defined on a per
project or on a per task basis, all the presented environment variables can be
seen on a per job basis.

## Predefined environment variables

Semaphore defines and uses its own environment variables.

### Semaphore related

This group of environment variables includes the environment variables that
are related to Semaphore 2.0 and hold information that is specific to Semaphore
2.0.

#### CI

The value of the `CI` environment variable specifies whether we are in a
Continuous Integration environment or not. The type of the `CI` variable is
boolean.

Example value: `true`

#### SEMAPHORE

The value of the `SEMAPHORE` environment variable says whether the job is
executed in the Semaphore 2.0 environment or not and is a boolean variable.

Example value: `true`

#### SEMAPHORE\_PROJECT\_NAME

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_PROJECT_NAME` environment variable holds the name
of the project a job belongs to.

Example value: `Documentation Project`

#### SEMAPHORE\_PROJECT\_ID

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable holds the project
ID of the project that a job belongs to.

Example value: `0dd982e8-32f5-4037-983e-4de01ac7fb1e`

#### SEMAPHORE\_ORGANIZATION\_URL

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_ORGANIZATION_URL` environment variable holds the url
of organization that owns the project on Semaphore.

Example value: `https://example.semaphoreci.com`

#### SEMAPHORE\_JOB\_NAME

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_JOB_NAME` environment variable is a string that
holds the name of the job.

Example value: `Push image to Docker`

#### SEMAPHORE\_JOB\_ID

The `SEMAPHORE_JOB_ID` environment variable holds the Job ID of the job that is
being executed. It is the same value as is displayed in the output of the
`sem get jobs` or the `sem get jobs --all` commands and is assigned by
Semaphore 2.0.

Example value: `a26d42cf-89ac-4c3f-9e2d-51bb231897bf`

#### SEMAPHORE\_JOB\_RESULT

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_JOB_RESULT` environment variable holds the result
of a job. The list of values includes `none`, `passed`, `failed` and `stopped`.

Example value: `passed`

#### SEMAPHORE\_WORKFLOW\_ID

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID` environment variable is the workflow
ID that is used during the execution of the active job.

The `SEMAPHORE_WORKFLOW_ID` environment variable remains the same during
a pipeline run and is available in all the blocks of a pipeline as well as in
all promoted and auto promoted pipelines.

Example value: `65c9bb1c-aeb6-41f0-b8d9-6fa177241cdf`

#### SEMAPHORE\_PIPELINE\_ID

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID` environment variable is the pipeline
ID that is used for the execution of the active job.

The `SEMAPHORE_PIPELINE_ID` environment variable remains the same throughout
all the blocks of a pipeline, which makes it the perfect candidate for sharing
data inside the same pipeline.

Example value: `ea3e6bba-d19a-45d7-86a0-e78a2301b616`

### Git repository related

This group of environment variables includes environment variables that are
used by Semaphore 2.0 and are related to GitHub and the GitHub repository that
is used in the current Semaphore 2.0 project.

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_SHA

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_SHA` environment variable holds the current
revision of code that the pipeline is using.

Example values: `5c84719708b9b649b9ef3b56af214f38cee6acde`, `HEAD`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_URL

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_URL` environment variable is the URL of the
GitHub repository used in the current Semaphore 2.0 project.

Example value: `http://git@github.com:semaphoreci/toolbox.git`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_BRANCH

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH` environment variable is the name of
the GitHub branch that is used in the current job.

In builds triggered by a Pull Request the value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_BRANCH`
is the name of the GitHub branch targeted by the Pull Request.

Example value: `development`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_DIR

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_DIR` environment variable is the name of the
directory that contains the files of the GitHub repository of the current
Semaphore 2.0 project.

Example value: `foo`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_REPO\_SLUG

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_REPO_SLUG` environment variable is the
name (in form: owner_name/repo_name) of the GitHub repository of the current
Semaphore 2.0 project.

Example value: `semaphoreci/docs`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_REF\_TYPE

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_REF_TYPE` environment variable indicates
the git reference type.

Example value: `branch`, `tag`, `pull-request`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_REF

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_REF` environment variable holds the name of
git reference to commit that the pipeline is using.

Example value: `refs/heads/master`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_COMMIT\_RANGE

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_COMMIT_RANGE` environment variable holds
the range of commits that were included in the push or pull request.

This is empty for builds triggered by the initial commit of a new branch or tag.

Example value: `5c84719708b9b649b9ef3b56af214f38cee6acde...92d87d5c0dd2dbb7a68ecb27df43d1b164fd3e30`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_TAG\_NAME

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_PR\_BRANCH

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_PR_BRANCH` environment variable is the name of
the GitHub branch from which the Pull Request originated.

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_PR\_SLUG

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_PR_SLUG` environment variable is the

Example values: `1`

#### SEMAPHORE\_GIT\_PR\_NAME

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_GIT_PR_NAME` environment variable holds the
name of the Pull Request.

### Cache related

The following environment variables are related to the `cache` utility. You can

#### SEMAPHORE\_CACHE\_USERNAME

The value of the `SEMAPHORE_CACHE_USERNAME` environment variable is the
username that will be used for connecting to the cache server.

### Private Docker Registry related variables

Private Docker registry is a beta feature that is available on a request.
You can find more information on [Private Docker Registry] page.

This feature adds the following environment variables to every job for a given project:

- `SEMAPHORE\_REGISTRY\_USERNAME` - Semaphore private Docker Registry username
- `SEMAPHORE\_REGISTRY\_PASSWORD` - Semaphore private Docker Registry password
